Security expert Caleb Barlow calls out the insufficiency of our current strategies to protect our data. His solution? We need to respond to cybercrime with the same collective effort as we apply to a health care crisis, sharing timely information on who is infected and how the disease is spreading. If we're not sharing, he says, then we're part of the problem.\n\nTEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

Tribal attorney and Couchiching First Nation citizen Tara Houska chronicles the history of attempts by government and industry to eradicate the legitimacy of indigenous peoples' land and culture, including the months-long standoff at Standing Rock which rallied thousands around the world. \"It's incredible what you can do when you stand together,\" Houska says. \"Stand with us -- empathize, learn, grow, change the conversation.\"\n\nCheck out more TED Talks: ",

        "videoDescription": "Things are pretty shocking out there right now -- record-breaking storms, deadly terror attacks, thousands of migrants disappearing beneath the waves and openly supremacist movements rising. Are we responding with the urgency that these overlapping crises demand from us? Journalist and activist Naomi Klein studies how governments use large-scale shocks to push societies backward. She shares a few propositions from \"The Leap\" -- a manifesto she wrote alongside indigenous elders, climate change activists, union leaders and others from different backgrounds -- which envisions a world after we've already made the transition to a clean economy and a much fairer society. \"The shocking events that fill us with dread today can transform us, and they can transform the world for the better,\" Klein says. \"But first we need to picture the world that we're fighting for. And we have to dream it up together.\"\n\nCheck out more TED Talks: ",

In this inspiring, pragmatic talk, Hayhoe shows how the key to having a real discussion is to connect over shared values like family, community and religion -- and to prompt people to realize that they already care about a changing climate. \"We can't give in to despair,\" she says. \"We have to go out and look for the hope we need to inspire us to act -- and that hope begins with a conversation, today.\"\n\nCheck out more TED Talks: ",

And she isn't alone in using synthetic biology to redefine our material future; think -- \"leather\" made from mushrooms and superstrong yarn made from spider-silk protein. We're not going to build the future with fossil fuels, Chieza says. We're going to build it with biology.\n\nCheck out more TED Talks: ",

In this mind-bending talk, Adams breaks down what happened when, in September 2015, LIGO detected an unthinkably small anomaly, leading to one of the most exciting discoveries in the history of physics.\n\nTEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

She has designed and built several large-scale installations, most notably the Swimming Cities of Switchback Sea at Deitch Projects in 2008. Her pieces have been collected by The Museum of Modern Art, Brooklyn Museum of Art, & the Tate Modern. Major pieces have appeared at PS1, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, and Black Rat Press. Swoon is also an instigator and a collaborator. She founded the Toyshop collective and the Miss Rockaway Armada, and is a member of Just Seeds and the Transformazium. Since 2006 she has organized four large-scale raft projects and floated down the Mississippi and Hudson rivers with them. Most recently, she and her collaborators designed a flotilla of sea-going rafts that invaded the 2009 Venice Biennale. Her artistic process is predicated on the belief that art is an immersive, provocative, and transformative experience for its participants. Although her aesthetics can be seen as an outgrowth of street art, her engagement with ethical living and making art share a close kinship with the idealism of off-grid, barter-based cultures and economies based on sharing. She uses scavenged and local materials and embraces print media as a potent means of action for social change. \n\nWhat is TEDx?\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx.

Unless a cure or treatment for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is found, Charley will lose his ability to walk by adolescence, and subsequently lose all muscle function. Like all boys with Duchenne, he will die from respiratory or heart failure in his late teens or early twenties. Charley's Fund was incorporated four months after the diagnosis. By refusing to surrender, the Seckler's turned a basic assumption on its head -- that the most complicated problems require a phd or an expert to come up with solutions.

After two years of designing the project, the Red de Innovaci√≥n y Aprendizaje (RIA) or Learning and Innovation Network was inaugurated in 2009 as a network of community centers that provide education with the use of technology.

The RIA has currently reached more than 115,000 users in less than two years of operating and has graduated more than 28,000 users.

Their nonviolent campaign to unseat Serbian president Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá met with success in October 2000, when hundreds of thousands of protestors converged upon and took over the Serbian Parliament, effectively ending Milo≈°eviƒá's rule. Srƒëa says that 2011 is already \"A Very Bad Year For Very Bad Guys\" and it is worth understanding how people power, or the real power behind the on-going dramatic events in the Arab Spring and beyond actually works. This can help us predict events and scenarios not only in the on-going Arab struggles, but also in places like Burma and Belarus.\n\nSrƒëa spoke at TEDxKrak√≥w, an independently organised TED event which took place on 20 October 2011 at the Manggha Centre for Japanese Art and Technology in Krak√≥w, Poland. Our theme was \"The New Normal\" and we asked our speakers to tell us about what we might just have to get used to once the dust settles from the various ongoing geopolitical, financial and environmental crises.\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations).\n\nPolish:\nTranslation: Rysia Wand\nReview: Krystian Aparta\n\nEnglish:\nOriginal subtitles: Krystian Aparta\n\nGerman:\nTranslation: Katja Tongucer\n\nSpanish:\nTranslation: Lidia C√°mara de la Fuente\n\nFrench:\nTranslation: Laurent Penou\n\nSerbian:\nTranslation: Ivana Korom",
