        "videoDescription": "Can we solve the problem of ocean plastic pollution and end extreme poverty at the same time? That's the ambitious goal of The Plastic Bank: a worldwide chain of stores where everything from school tuition to cooking fuel and more is available for purchase in exchange for plastic garbage -- which is then sorted, shredded and sold to brands who reuse \"social plastic\" in their products. Join David Katz to learn more about this step towards closing the loop in the circular economy. \"Preventing ocean plastic could be humanity's richest opportunity,\" Katz says.\n\nCheck out more TED Talks: ",

Imagination allows us to break down borders, to move beyond our circumstances, to create and constantly progress.\n\nAmy Purdy has been through hardships that most of us will never face -- or can even fathom. But what makes her story so incredible is not that fact that she lived a \"normal\" childhood and spent her high school years as a passionate artist and snowboarder, then traumatically lost both her legs at age 19, but how she has persevered, taking implausible challenges and rising above them.\nToday, Amy is an athlete; currently the top ranked adaptive female snowboarder in the world. Amy also spends a good amount of time helping others; specifically those with physical challenges get involved with snowboarding, skateboarding, wakeboarding and other action sports through the organization she co-founded Adaptive Action Sports. Challenging herself while making a positive impact on the world is a true testament to Amy's spirit.\n\nAbout TEDx.\nTEDx was created in the spirit of TED's mission, \"ideas worth spreading.\" The program is designed to give communities, organizations and individuals the opportunity to stimulate dialogue through TED-like experiences at the local level.\n\nAt TEDx events, a screening of TEDTalks videos -- or a combination of live presenters and TEDTalks videos -- sparks deep conversation and connections.

It's a radical rethink of what drives us to do our best work, and what it means to be a leader. Because as Heffernan points out: “Companies don’t have ideas. Only people do.”\n\nTEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

        "videoDescription": "Regret is one of our most powerful emotions -- and also one of the most misunderstood. Over the past two years, author Daniel H. Pink has collected a trove of more than 16,000 regrets from people in 105 countries in an effort to better understand this mysterious emotion. He shares the key patterns that emerged (it all boils down to the same four core regrets, he says) and explains how to transform your own regrets in order to create the life you've always wanted to live.

At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

She has designed and built several large-scale installations, most notably the Swimming Cities of Switchback Sea at Deitch Projects in 2008. Her pieces have been collected by The Museum of Modern Art, Brooklyn Museum of Art, & the Tate Modern. Major pieces have appeared at PS1, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, and Black Rat Press. Swoon is also an instigator and a collaborator. She founded the Toyshop collective and the Miss Rockaway Armada, and is a member of Just Seeds and the Transformazium. Since 2006 she has organized four large-scale raft projects and floated down the Mississippi and Hudson rivers with them. Most recently, she and her collaborators designed a flotilla of sea-going rafts that invaded the 2009 Venice Biennale. Her artistic process is predicated on the belief that art is an immersive, provocative, and transformative experience for its participants. Although her aesthetics can be seen as an outgrowth of street art, her engagement with ethical living and making art share a close kinship with the idealism of off-grid, barter-based cultures and economies based on sharing. She uses scavenged and local materials and embraces print media as a potent means of action for social change. \n\nWhat is TEDx?\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx.

Charley's devilish smile belies what is going on inside his body, for his muscles are deteriorating at an alarming pace. Unless a cure or treatment for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is found, Charley will lose his ability to walk by adolescence, and subsequently lose all muscle function. Like all boys with Duchenne, he will die from respiratory or heart failure in his late teens or early twenties. Charley's Fund was incorporated four months after the diagnosis. By refusing to surrender, the Seckler's turned a basic assumption on its head -- that the most complicated problems require a phd or an expert to come up with solutions. Their experience teaches us that in fact, it is determination and innovation that can drive toward a solution.

At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.

Engaged at the age of 5, she was to be circumcised by the time she became a teenager. But she had a different plan. First, she negotiated with her father: she would willingly agree to be circumcised only if he would allow her to finish high school. He agreed. Then she negotiated with the village elders to do what no girl had ever done before: leave her village to go to college in the United States. She received a scholarship to Randolph Macon college in Virginia and returned to Kenya to change her hometown forever.\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group.

In 2006, in conjunction with the Universidad Autónoma de México (UNAM), Aleph conducted an in-depth study on the effects of solid residue disposal and urban approaches to Mexico City's periphery. The study formed the conceptual basis of a documentary film on the processes of Mexico City's trash cycle and the lives of trash pickers living in the outskirts of the city.\nIn 2008 Aleph founded the Fundación Proacceso ECO with the objective of reducing the digital divide and providing access to quality education. After two years of designing the project, the Red de Innovación y Aprendizaje (RIA) or Learning and Innovation Network was inaugurated in 2009 as a network of community centers that provide education with the use of technology. Today, the network has grown to 42 educational centers located in 28 municipalities with a high degree of poverty and lack of infrastructure. The RIA has currently reached more than 115,000 users in less than two years of operating and has graduated more than 28,000 users. By the end of this year the network will be expanded to 70 educational centers and will reach approximately 350,000 users by the end of 2012.

And if so, is it possible to overcome it?\n\n--\n\nThe question of whether or not humans are inherently selfish is one of philosophy’s oldest debates. The idea that we only act out of self-interest is an extreme stance that few philosophers would endorse. However, the idea that all humans have a deep selfish streak is something many philosophers would agree with. So, are we innately selfish?

So what happens when the system breaks down and the machinery turns on itself, leading to cancer? Greg Foot dives into the science of how biologists are biohacking the human body to try to fix the seemingly unfixable. \n\nLesson by Greg Foot, directed by Pierangelo Pirak.\n\nProduced for TED-Ed by ",

Squishy cylinders? Jagged zig-zags? You might not spend a lot of time thinking about the bodies of these building blocks, but microscopically, small variations can have huge consequences. And while some adaptations change these shapes for the better, others can spark debilitating complications.

The problem is, the genetics that researchers are combing through are heavily biased to those of people from European descent, and often overlook other ethnicities.

Open this video in the YouTube app on your phone.\n2. Hit pause on the video.\n3. Tap the 3 vertical dots on the top right corner of the view window. This will slide up a sub-menu where you will choose the quality setting of your video stream. Choose \"2160s.\" Note that if you are not streaming over Wifi, YouTube will only allow \"720s\" quality.\n4. Tap on the “Cardboard viewer” icon on the bottom row of the video window (it looks like a mask). This will present the video full screen in prep for the Cardboard viewer.\n5. The screen is now divided into 2 halves, separated by a thin white line that runs halfway up the screen. Make sure to rotate your phone so that this thin line is coming from the bottom of the screen. This ensures proper stereoscopic depth.\n6. Insert your phone into the Cardboard viewer and press play. The video will begin. Enjoy!\n\nIf you do not have access to a Cardboard or smart phone:\n\n1. You can watch on your browser. Use your mouse to drag and explore the space above, below, and behind you. Enjoy!\n\nView full lesson: ",
