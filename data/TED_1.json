            "So today, I’m really here to talk to you all about one thing:\n",
            "the universe.\n",
            "In the world of particle physics,\n",
            "the ultimate goal is to be able to describe\n",
            "all the particles and forces that make up our universe.\n",
            "And while we've made an extraordinary amount of progress in this\n",
            "over the past 100 years,\n",
            "we're doing it still,\n",
            "because there are big mysteries about what the universe is made of\n",
            "and how we came to be here.\n",
            "So let me start by introducing you\n",
            "to three of the big mysteries about our universe.\n",
            "First, we know that the universe is expanding.\n",
            "So astrophysical evidence suggests\n",
            "that the universe started as a very dense, very hot Big Bang,\n",
            "and has since been expanding outwards from that point.\n",
            "However, as a complete shock, in the late '90s,\n",
            "physicists discovered that the expansion of the universe\n",
            "isn't slowing down, as you might expect --\n",
            "it's actually accelerating,\n",
            "and we have absolutely no idea as to why this is.\n",
            "All that we know is that some unknown source or force of nature\n",
            "is stretching the universe out in every direction,\n",
            "at an ever-increasing rate.\n",
            "And because we don't know what that source is,\n",
            "we've just called it \"dark energy.\"\n",
            "Now, what we do know about dark energy\n",
            "is that it makes up roughly 74 percent of the energy content of our universe.\n",
            "So straight off the bat,\n",
            "that's 74 percent of our universe that we know absolutely nothing about.\n",
            "Second, we know that 85 percent of all the matter in our universe\n",
            "is made up of something called dark matter.\n",
            "Now, this photo that you're looking at here\n",
            "is a picture from the Hubble Space Telescope,\n",
            "which shows a cluster of galaxies\n",
            "four billion light years away from the Earth.\n",
            "And what's interesting here\n",
            "is the left and right parts of this photograph,\n",
            "because they're actually the same photo.\n",
            "But what you're looking at in the right photo\n",
            "is that it's had a blue filter applied to it,\n",
            "to emphasize the light that's coming towards us\n",
            "from the distant universe.\n",
            "And what you can see is a dark ring,\n",
            "indicating a clearly reduced amount of light coming towards us.\n",
            "Now we believe that this ring is a halo of dark matter.\n",
            "Now we have no idea what dark matter is,\n",
            "and we've never observed it in experiments here on Earth,\n",
            "but we know from several corroborating astrophysical observations\n",
            "that it has to be there.\n",
            "Importantly, another thing that we know about dark matter\n",
            "is that it makes up another 21 percent of the energy content of our universe.\n",
            "So that, coupled with the dark energy problem,\n",
            "means that we only know what five percent of our universe is made of,\n",
            "and the rest is totally dark to us.\n",
            "The third problem concerns how we've come to exist at all.\n",
            "Now, fundamental particles of matter have their own antimatter particles,\n",
            "which are the same as their normal matter counterparts,\n",
            "except they have opposite positive or negative charge,\n",
            "just like the two ends of a normal, everyday battery.\n",
            "Now together, this charge is equal and balanced.\n",
            "The electron, for example,\n",
            "which we're a bit more familiar with -- it gives us electricity in our homes --\n",
            "is negatively charged.\n",
            "But it has an antimatter partner called the positron,\n",
            "which is positively charged.\n",
            "Now to ensure this balance,\n",
            "matter and antimatter are always created and destroyed equally and in pairs.\n",
            "This is what all of our theories predict,\n",
            "and this is what we observe in all of our experiments.\n",
            "And so in the Big Bang,\n",
            "we would [have] expected that matter and antimatter\n",
            "would have been created in equal amounts,\n",
            "and so we would expect to see equal amounts of matter and antimatter\n",
            "in the universe today.\n",
            "However, nearly every structure of matter,\n",
            "every natural structure of matter in our universe --\n",
            "you, me, the Earth, the stars --\n",
            "are made almost entirely of normal matter,\n",
            "leaving a lot of antimatter missing from the balanced equation.\n",
            "For all you Marvel and Avengers fans out there,\n",
            "it's a bit like someone's just snapped their fingers,\n",
            "and half of all the natural stuff in the universe has disappeared.\n",
            "There literally should be\n",
            "another universe's worth of stuff all around us,\n",
            "but somehow, it's not there.\n",
            "And one of the greatest challenges in particle physics today\n",
            "is to figure out what happened to all the antimatter\n",
            "and why we see an asymmetry between matter and antimatter at all.\n",
            "So those are three of the big mysteries about our universe.\n",
            "And that's a lot of what we don't know.\n",
            "Now, what this means\n",
            "is our current understanding of the universe, up until this point,\n",
            "can't tell us why the universe is the way it is,\n",
            "or what 95 percent of it is made of.\n",
            "But importantly, each of these mysteries --\n",
            "what is dark energy, what is dark matter\n",
            "and the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe --\n",
            "could all be solved by finding a new particle\n",
            "or a new force of nature.\n",
            "So now, let me introduce you\n",
            "to our current understanding of the universe.\n",
            "This is it.\n",
            "The standard model of particle physics,\n",
            "the mathematical equation, which I’m sure you’re all very used to.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Which describes how our universe works.\n",
            "You can think of it as the recipe\n",
            "for how all the particles and forces in the universe\n",
            "interact and result in the structures of matter\n",
            "that we see around us.\n",
            "Now this equation represents a huge level of achievement\n",
            "over the past 100 years,\n",
            "and in its full form, it's much longer, but simplified,\n",
            "like this,\n",
            "you see a very elegant, I think,\n",
            "elegant representation of the structure of matter.\n",
            "And then, if that equation is the recipe,\n",
            "then these are the ingredients.\n",
            "Just 17 ingredients, 17 fundamental particles,\n",
            "where \"fundamental\" here means they're not known to have a substructure,\n",
            "they're not known to be composed of any smaller particles.\n",
            "And together with the equation on the previous slide,\n",
            "they make up the standard model of particle physics.\n",
            "And it is our best, most tested and globally accepted theory\n",
            "of all the known particles and forces in the universe.\n",
            "And it's given rise to much of what we take for granted\n",
            "in the modern world of today.\n",
            "A good example would be our ability now to harness the energy from the Sun,\n",
            "where our ability to use solar power and our moves towards nuclear fusion\n",
            "couldn't be possible\n",
            "without understanding the particles and forces of the standard model.\n",
            "Now, whilst the standard model has been so successful\n",
            "at testing the phenomena that we can test here on Earth,\n",
            "it cannot accommodate and has no explanation for\n",
            "those big mysteries about our universe.\n",
            "And so it's at this point that I'd like to introduce you\n",
            "to a particular particle,\n",
            "and the hero of our story, the muon.\n",
            "Now, muons may seem unfamiliar to you all,\n",
            "but actually, they’re around us all the time.\n",
            "Cosmic rays that hit the Earth's atmosphere\n",
            "result in showers of muons that constantly bombard the Earth.\n",
            "You may be surprised to learn, for example,\n",
            "that there are, on average, 30 muons\n",
            "traveling through each and every one of you every second.\n",
            "Now, muons can be thought of, quite simply,\n",
            "as the heavy cousin of the electron,\n",
            "and they sit next to the electron in this picture,\n",
            "and they're about 200 times heavier.\n",
            "But importantly, they’re an ideal tool for physicists to use\n",
            "to search and look for new particles and forces\n",
            "to explain those big mysteries.\n",
            "And so why is that?\n",
            "Well, let's assume for a second that we can represent a muon\n",
            "by this gyroscope.\n",
            "When you spin a gyroscope,\n",
            "it wobbles around its axis, just like that.\n",
            "And muons have an identical behavior\n",
            "when you place them in a magnetic field, they spin and they wobble.\n",
            "Now whilst they're doing this,\n",
            "the muon will come into contact\n",
            "with any and all other particles in the universe,\n",
            "standard model or otherwise.\n",
            "And in fact, it's the interaction of the muon with those other particles\n",
            "that defines how fast it wobbles.\n",
            "In essence, the more different particles\n",
            "that bounce off the muon whilst it is wobbling,\n",
            "the faster it will wobble.\n",
            "And so then this is what we want to measure --\n",
            "how fast muons wobble in a magnetic field\n",
            "due to their interaction with all the particles and forces\n",
            "in the universe.\n",
            "Now so far, no new particle or force outside of the standard model\n",
            "that could explain those big mysteries about our universe\n",
            "has ever been discovered.\n",
            "But the point to reemphasize\n",
            "is that the rate or the speed by which muons wobble\n",
            "when we place them in a magnetic field\n",
            "is directly defined by all the particles and forces in the universe\n",
            "that it comes into contact with.\n",
            "And so, if we can measure very precisely how fast they wobble,\n",
            "we can then compare that to the theoretical prediction\n",
            "of how fast they should wobble\n",
            "from just the particles and forces of the standard model.\n",
            "And then, if the measurement was found to be different and larger and disagree,\n",
            "then it would be an indication of new particles or forces\n",
            "outside of the standard model\n",
            "that could explain those big mysteries about our universe.\n",
            "An experiment I work on has done just that.\n",
            "This is the Muon g-2 experiment located at Fermilab,\n",
            "on the outskirts of Chicago.\n",
            "This ring, which you can see here,\n",
            "is about 20 meters in diameter,\n",
            "and it's what's called a storage ring magnet.\n",
            "It's a ring in which we store muons inside a magnetic field,\n",
            "which causes them to wobble.\n",
            "We then make our measurements of how fast they wobble\n",
            "and compare that to the theory.\n",
            "Now, this experiment released its first result in April of 2021,\n",
            "and the take-home message of this talk\n",
            "is that the result I am presenting to you here today,\n",
            "from the Muon g-2 experiment,\n",
            "is the closest glimpse that we've had to seeing a new particle or force\n",
            "here in a laboratory on Earth.\n",
            "And this is that result here.\n",
            "So let me take some time to explain to you what this graph is showing.\n",
            "On the x-axis are the values for how fast muons wobble\n",
            "when we place them in a magnetic field.\n",
            "The green marker on the left\n",
            "is the theoretical prediction for how fast they wobble,\n",
            "from just the particles of the standard model,\n",
            "and the green band defines the uncertainty on that prediction.\n",
            "The orange marker on the right is the new experimental measurement\n",
            "from the Fermilab Muon g-2 experiment,\n",
            "and the orange band defines the uncertainty on that measurement.\n",
            "And by uncertainty, I mean we're statistically certain\n",
            "that both the prediction and the measurement,\n",
            "the value for each should be inside their respective bands.\n",
            "And what you can see is not only do those bands not overlap,\n",
            "but they differ by quite a large amount,\n",
            "that white gap in the middle indicating a clear disagreement\n",
            "between the two values.\n",
            "What this means is that when muons are placed in a magnetic field,\n",
            "they wobble faster than what the theory predicts.\n",
            "So all the known particles and forces of the standard model\n",
            "have failed to predict how fast muons have wobbled.\n",
            "And what does this suggest?\n",
            "Well, it suggests that there are new particles or forces\n",
            "that aren’t part of that globally accepted theory\n",
            "interacting with the muons and causing them to wobble faster.\n",
            "Now, a reason why physicists are so excited about this result\n",
            "is that the chance that this result is a fluke, statistically,\n",
            "is one in 40,000.\n",
            "So that's the same as saying that there's a 99.9975 percent chance\n",
            "that we've seen the influence of a new particle or force\n",
            "here, in a laboratory on Earth.\n",
            "But a word of caution.\n",
            "Physicists actually set a much stricter threshold\n",
            "by which they can claim a discovery,\n",
            "and that is the chance the result is a fluke\n",
            "cannot be more than one in 3.5 million.\n",
            "And so we haven't reached that discovery threshold yet,\n",
            "and so we can't definitively say\n",
            "that we've seen the influence of a new particle or force.\n",
            "And the reality is that,\n",
            "to reach the one-in-3.5-million threshold,\n",
            "there's a lot of work to be done.\n",
            "But that work is being done right now\n",
            "and will continue to be done over the coming years.\n",
            "So what does this all mean?\n",
            "Well, first, any result from the Muon g-2 experiment,\n",
            "even a result that says there were no new particles or forces,\n",
            "would be a good result.\n",
            "That is science, right?\n",
            "Sometimes, it's not discovering new things,\n",
            "sometimes, it's just confirming old things.\n",
            "And even if that were the case,\n",
            "the by-products of particle physics experiments\n",
            "have been advancing human civilization for much of the past 100 years.\n",
            "Modern electronics, the internet, satellite navigation --\n",
            "these are all by-products of particle physics experiments or endeavors.\n",
            "And there's no telling\n",
            "what experiments like the Muon g-2 experiment\n",
            "could do for us in the future.\n",
            "But if that were the case, and we found no new particle or force,\n",
            "then we wouldn't be able to explain those big mysteries about our universe --\n",
            "what is dark energy, what is dark matter\n",
            "and where did all the antimatter go?\n",
            "Whatever the outcome,\n",
            "the Muon g-2 experiment will keep releasing results,\n",
            "in the next few years,\n",

            "she was literally at death's door.\n",
            "Her husband had died,\n",
            "she had fallen into a deep depression, she had stopped eating.\n",
            "She didn't have the stamina to walk door to door to sell the eggs,\n",
            "which is what was supporting her family.\n",
            "Her daughters watched helplessly\n",
            "as she gave every last penny she had to them.\n",
            "Until a neighbor said,\n",
            "“Right down the street, there’s a city-run, free women’s clinic\n",
            "where you can get help.\"\n",
            "And that conversation changed her life.\n",
            "She went to the center.\n",
            "They treated her for malnutrition.\n",
            "They gave her the mental health care she needed and other health support.\n",
            "And now Anna and her two daughters make tortillas in a small,\n",
            "women-owned business,\n",
            "and that's enough to support her family.\n",
            "Anna was saved by information.\n",
            "So you hear that story and you probably think,\n",
            "\"Ah, another nice NGO doing some good work around the world.\"\n",
            "But when I hear that story,\n",
            "I think how the right information at the right time\n",
            "actually saved a woman's life.\n",
            "That information saved Anna's life.\n",
            "At the Carter Center,\n",
            "we work in global health and peace around the world,\n",
            "and I've been in the business long enough to know that there is no silver bullet\n",
            "to solving our world's problems,\n",
            "but the closest thing we have is access to information.\n",
            "And I consider that a master key, because it unlocks human rights\n",
            "for everyone around the world.\n",
            "And it's because of that that Anna's life and many other women's lives were saved.\n",
            "So when you work for President Carter,\n",
            "you spend a lot of time thinking about human rights.\n",
            "And when your other boss is Rosalynn Carter,\n",
            "you spend a lot of time thinking about women's rights.\n",
            "My favorite thing on Mrs. Carter's desk is a picture that she keeps\n",
            "of a group of women in front of the White House in 1977,\n",
            "protesting against the Equal Rights Amendment.\n",
            "And when I asked her, \"Why do you keep that on your desk?\"\n",
            "She said, because she wanted to be reminded\n",
            "of the work that she had left to do.\n",
            "Now, you don't have to be a former president of the United States,\n",
            "or a former first lady,\n",
            "to understand the power of sharing information.\n",
            "Honestly, obviously the platform does not hurt.\n",
            "But what we do now is we look at how we match information needs\n",
            "with information wants that exist.\n",
            "So when we talk to President Carter\n",
            "about the fact that there's a gap\n",
            "between how men and women receive information,\n",
            "we ask very specifically, we want to run a program on this.\n",
            "But he is a very disciplined engineer,\n",
            "and he said, \"It's an interesting thesis, but can you prove it\n",
            "and can you come up with a program\n",
            "that's actually going to make a difference?\"\n",
            "So not working on anecdotal information,\n",
            "we decided to survey about 2,000 women --\n",
            "people in Guatemala, Liberia, Bangladesh --\n",
            "and we wanted to ask government offices: “Are women seeking information?”\n",
            "And so when you go into a government office,\n",
            "you'll find women who might be sitting there,\n",
            "if they brave the odds,\n",
            "but they're being ignored, they're being questioned,\n",
            "or they're actually being derided.\n",
            "And so we thought, what are the barriers to finding this information for women?\n",
            "Well we all know,\n",
            "data illiteracy is greater among women.\n",
            "They have less chance of education,\n",
            "transportation can be very difficult.\n",
            "You look at gender norms and cultural norms,\n",
            "often women are responsible for not only full-time childcare\n",
            "but also raising the family and working.\n",
            "And it also can be very dangerous if they take transportation on their own.\n",
            "And so one government office building,\n",
            "we noticed that there were no women's bathrooms.\n",
            "So if anyone had gone in to try to seek the information,\n",
            "they were there all day without a restroom.\n",
            "So we thought, what can we do to change the situation?\n",
            "So we decided that all politics is local and all development is local.\n",
            "And so we hired local information liaisons\n",
            "to help connect the dots for women to get the information they needed.\n",
            "For example, in Dhaka in Bangladesh,\n",
            "there was a woman who wanted to get a streetlight in her slum,\n",
            "but her father had said, \"Don't ask for the information.\n",
            "This is not your position.\n",
            "You won't get it.\"\n",
            "So when the street lamp showed up, he was incredibly proud of her.\n",
            "And in Liberia,\n",
            "a group of women came together and they sought information\n",
            "on county development funds.\n",
            "And with that money,\n",
            "they were able to open a soap business.\n",
            "And that created an entire community of women entrepreneurs.\n",
            "So it's great to do this one information liaison at a time.\n",
            "But the reality is we wanted to scale up.\n",
            "So in 2021, in the middle of the pandemic,\n",
            "we decided to start a campaign called Inform Women, Transform Lives.\n",
            "And it was to connect women with information\n",
            "that was out there that they did not have.\n",
            "So we're now on five continents, across 35 different cities,\n",
            "from Atlanta to Chicago,\n",
            "from Dublin to Rotterdam,\n",
            "from Sao Paulo to Kathmandu.\n",
            "And it hits 215 million people,\n",
            "215 million citizens who can be affected by information\n",
            "through the city's programs.\n",
            "So this is how it works.\n",
            "We start with the city,\n",
            "we find a city service that women have access to\n",
            "but they don't know about it\n",
            "because they haven't been told.\n",
            "And then we run radio jingles,\n",
            "we do murals, we do transit ads,\n",
            "we use social media,\n",
            "and we get them the information.\n",
            "We meet women where they are.\n",
            "So it seems quite simple.\n",
            "and the results were real.\n",
            "In Sao Paulo there was 86 percent uptick in the information\n",
            "that was received for gender-based violence and domestic violence.\n",
            "In Nairobi, we were able to put the sign up\n",
            "that actually was a hotline for women who wanted help on domestic violence.\n",
            "Before this billboard went up,\n",
            "there were 10 calls to that hotline.\n",
            "After this billboard went up, there were 500 calls.\n",
            "That's 490 women who needed the assistance the month before\n",
            "but didn't even know it existed.\n",
            "(Applause)\n",
            "In Cape Town, we brought women together from a township,\n",
            "we brought them to the public library.\n",
            "We had the city talk about how to access information services,\n",
            "and there was an uptick in everything\n",
            "from requests for street cleaning to COVID vaccinations.\n",
            "And in Kampala,\n",
            "women were able to get increased loans\n",
            "so women entrepreneurs could start.\n",
            "In Chicago,\n",
            "the benefit of having a city keycard\n",
            "was something that many women didn't know about\n",
            "until we started the campaign.\n",
            "It serves as a government ID,\n",
            "a health prescription card, a transit card,\n",
            "a public library card,\n",
            "and there was a 225 percent uptick\n",
            "in requests for the city of Chicago.\n",
            "And then here in Atlanta,\n",
            "we have a program that we call “safe spots.”\n",
            "It’s a program that the city started to create, in fire stations,\n",
            "a safe spot for women and children\n",
            "who are going through domestic abuse to enter.\n",
            "The fire station shuts down,\n",
            "the immediate assistance is given to the person who needs it,\n",
            "and it's very difficult to walk into a police station\n",
            "if you're in a domestic abuse situation.\n",
            "But fire stations we've all been to,\n",
            "we've all sat there, we've rang the bell,\n",
            "people feel more comfortable.\n",
            "And we always have to check our assumptions\n",
            "because the reality is we thought\n",
            "this was going to be something that was used\n",
            "in the lower-income parts of town,\n",
            "but in fact, the data shows that in the more affluent areas,\n",
            "people are walking into those fire stations as safe spots.\n",
            "So we all do our work for very different reasons.\n",
            "I will tell you that I am the daughter\n",
            "of an incredibly amazing woman\n",
            "who taught me I could be anything that my three older brothers could be.\n",
            "I am now a mother of two amazing daughters, who are incredibly independent,\n",
            "and a very well-trained and sensitized teenage son.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "We need more of those.\n",
            "(Applause)\n",
            "And often it’s my vision of Mrs. Carter’s picture\n",
            "that is sitting on her desk\n",
            "reminding me that for 40 years she looked at that picture,\n",
            "and she knew that that was work that still needed to be done.\n",
            "Or, of course, it could be the fact that President Carter,\n",
            "who is 99 and still cares deeply about this issue,\n",
            "when he was 89, at the spry age of 89,\n",
            "he wrote a book on women's issues and human rights,\n",
            "and he gave a talk at TEDWomen.\n",
            "(Applause)\n",
            "He has always taught me\n",
            "that wherever we go in the world, people are intelligent,\n",
            "they care about their families, they're hardworking,\n",
            "but they often just don't have the information\n",
            "that they need to be successful.\n",
            "And so it's my job,\n",
            "it's all of our jobs,\n",

            "Can you share a little bit more how this project came to be? SJ: So the director of “American Symphony,”\n",
            "Matt Heineman, who is an extraordinarily brilliant filmmaker and a dear friend of ours,\n",
            "says that if you end up with a project that you started with,\n",
            "you're not doing your job right because you weren't listening along the way. And that proved to be true in ways that we couldn't possibly imagine.\n",
            "I knew Matt through my own work. Jon had worked with him on his last film, \"The First Wave,\"\n",
            "that took place during the pandemic, and he and Jon started talking about the idea\n",
            "of a short process film that was going to follow Jon as he composed what he called\n",
            "“American Symphony,” which was his reimagination of what a symphony would look like\n",
            "if it were created in the 21st century. And Jon was committed to really upturning what we think of as a symphony.\n",
            "He wanted to travel all across the country to recruit jazz musicians and blues musicians and classical musicians\n",
            "and Indigenous musicians and musicians who don't know how to read music and to figure out how to bring them all together.\n",
            "So initially, that was the film, and about a week after we decided to move forward with that project,\n",
            "on the very same day I began chemo and the same week I learned that after a decade-long remission,\n",
            "my leukemia was back, Jon was also nominated for a record historical number of Grammys.\n",
            "And so right from the beginning of the filming process,\n",
            "the initial conceit changed. And it was the kind of project\n",
            "and really a testament to Matt's style, where we weren't too worried about figuring out what the story was.\n",
            "Matt specializes in cinema verité, and so he followed us from sun up until we went to sleep every single day\n",
            "for about seven months. And at the end of that process, we had 1,500 hours of footage,\n",
            "which, as you can imagine, is a lot of footage. But we knew that we wanted to document all of it,\n",
            "to document what it means to be living a life of contrasts,\n",
            "what is required of us when we're in the belly of the beast and how creativity and our individual\n",

            "SJ: You know, it wasn't easy for either of us because we are used to,\n",
            "you know, captaining our own creative ships. But I think, you know, surrendering to the process was really important.\n",
            "We didn't want to get in the way of the filming. But we were also very much creative partners with Matt.\n",
            "And I'm not sure that a film like this would have been possible without deep trust with the filmmaker\n",

            "before I learned of my relapse. I was getting ready to write a reported book\n",
            "that would require me to be on the road for long stretches of time. Jon and I were talking about getting married and starting a family,\n",
            "and I moved through my own version of the five stages of grief. And the first is shock,\n",

            "I'm in the chrysalis. I'm as larval and goopy and unformed as I ever feel.\n",
            "And what these periods of being extremely sick\n",
            "have done for me is that I've had to get good with my own company. I've had to get good with quiet, with having no plans.\n",
            "And of course, that's not a luxury that we're all able to carve out for ourselves.\n",
            "But when I'm able to surrender to that not knowing, interesting things emerge.\n",

            "I was on two medications that caused my vision to blur and double.\n",
            "And so the thing that I had always reached for in times of duress,\n",
            "which for me is writing, wasn't as easily accessible to me. It was frustrating, it was hard, it was halting.\n",
            "And instead of trying to keep doing that, I decided to be open to whatever felt good.\n",
            "And for the first time since I was a little kid, I picked up some watercolors and some brushes.\n",
            "I transformed the bedside table in my hospital room into my little palette of paints,\n",
            "and I began painting the nightmares I was having, the fever dreams I was having,\n",
            "and transcribing them onto the canvas without any expectation of doing anything with these paintings\n",
            "other than that they simply felt good. What I love about watercolor is that you don't have much control.\n",
            "Watercolor is all about the beautiful, happy accidents. And so that felt like an apt medium,\n",
            "given the fact that my circumstances were very much mirroring that lack of control.\n",

            "And really, it requires complete surrender\n",
            "and an openness to whatever may emerge,\n",
            "and also a curiosity about the changes that are happening and trust that something will come out of it,\n",
            "even if it's just in terms of my own personal growth and the reshuffling of the priorities.\n",
            "Though often, well, it doesn't feel that way in the moment, it's ended up being my most fertile creative stretches\n",
            "where I’m pushed to experiment and to create in new ways.\n",
            "Not in spite of my limitations, but because of them. And it becomes a process of finding purpose in that pain\n",
            "and trying to alchemize it into something interesting and thought-provoking,\n",
            "and maybe even useful and beautiful. SZ: This leads me to think about 22-year-old you,\n",
            "you know, with your first leukemia diagnosis and your “Life, Interrupted” column in The New York Times.\n",

            "and overnight, I lost my job, I lost my apartment,\n",
            "I was working as a paralegal in Paris at the time, but hoping to become a foreign correspondent.\n",
            "And maybe worst of all, I lost my independence. And 22 is such a funny age\n",
            "where, you know, you're no longer a kid, yet, you're not a fully formed adult either.\n",
            "And so that sense of in-betweenness accompanied me from my very first day in the hospital.\n",
            "And I spent a really difficult first year of treatment, I spent about eight months, cumulatively,\n",
            "of that first year in isolation in the hospital where I wasn't able to leave my room.\n",
            "And when I went into this, not knowing anything about what it means to be sick,\n",
            "I remember packing a suitcase full of books like \"War and Peace\"\n",
            "and cheerfully announcing to my parents that I was going to use that first summer in the hospital\n",
            "to read through the rest of the Western canon. And let me tell you, naivete has a short shelf life.\n",
            "And that was true for me. I didn't read a single one of those books. And I felt really angry.\n",
            "My treatments were not working, my leukemia was becoming more aggressive.\n",
            "I was enrolled in a phase 2 clinical trial that hadn't yet been proven to be safe or effective.\n",
            "And I was really struggling with a sense that my life had been interrupted.\n",
            "My life had been put on pause at a time when I was watching my friends begin their lives,\n",
            "you know, travel the world, start careers, get married and all the other big and small milestones of early adulthood.\n",
            "After I learned that the treatments weren't working for me,\n",
            "that a friend of mine came up with the idea of a 100-day project, and the premise was really simple.\n",
            "We decided we were each going to do one creative act a day for 100 days. And for my project, I decided to keep the bar very low,\n",
            "knowing how unpredictable my energy was, and I decided to recommit to the thing that had been my companion\n",
            "from the time I could hold a pen, which was, keeping a journal. And it didn't matter how much I wrote.\n",
            "Sometimes it was many pages, sometimes it was a sentence. Occasionally it was the F-word,\n",
            "which felt apt for that particular moment. But in the course of keeping that journal,\n",
            "something interesting began to happen. Prior to this project, I, you know, of course, was not in a place\n",
            "where I could become a foreign correspondent in the way that I dreamed of.\n",
            "But I realized, in keeping my journal, that I was using it as a kind of reporter's notebook.\n",
            "I was writing about all the things that felt impossible to talk about\n",
            "with my loved ones. I was writing about the sense of guilt\n",
            "and being a burden, that can come with being sick. I was writing about navigating our health care system.\n",
            "I was writing about the patients I was befriending in the cancer unit. I was writing about the nurses and the various characters\n",
            "in my medical team. I was writing about sexual health, I was writing about shame, I was writing about what it feels like to fall in love while you're falling sick.\n",
            "And by the end of that project, I realized that, you know,\n",
            "while I couldn't travel the world and report on the stories of others,\n",
            "I did have a story to tell, and that I was reporting from a different kind of conflict zone.\n",
            "I was reporting from the front lines of my hospital bed. And so, like the good millennial that I am, I decided to start a blog.\n",
            "It was in the weeks leading up to a bone marrow transplant, and I knew that the odds were stacked against me.\n",
            "My doctors told me point blank I had a 35-percent chance of long-term survival,\n",
            "and I think it lit a kind of fire under me.\n",
            "Staring your mortality straight in the eye can be a great motivator. There's no longer this illusion of endless time.\n",
            "Time to eventually get to the things that you want to do, time to figure out what you want to contribute in whatever, you know,\n",
            "small or big way, to the world. And so I kept this blog for a couple of weeks and I took it really seriously.\n",
            "I would write every day, and through an old journalism professor of mine,\n",
            "it got sent to Tara Parker-Pope, my wonderful editor at The New York Times,\n",
            "and we had a couple of email exchanges, and she called me and invited me to contribute an essay.\n",
            "And I took a deep breath and I said, \"Thank you, but I'm not interested in writing an essay.\n",
            "What I'm interested in writing is a weekly column, because so often illness stories are told from the vantage point\n",
            "of someone who survived. But I want to write from the trenches of that uncertainty.\"\n",
            "And I went on and on and on. And to my surprise, she said, \"OK, we'll try it for a couple of installments and see how it goes.\"\n",
            "And I had never been published before, I'd never had a byline, and this pitch that I had just performed\n",
            "would have seemed wildly presumptuous to pre-diagnosis 22-year-old me.\n",
            "I would have been grateful for a fact-checking position. But that's the thing about confronting your mortality,\n",
            "is that ... it can make you brazen.\n",

            "the hardest part of my cancer experience, on a personal level,\n",
            "began once the cancer was gone. I very quickly realized,\n",
            "you know, of course, that I was no longer a patient, but that I couldn't go back to the person I'd been pre-diagnosis.\n",
            "And I had no idea who I was and how to find my footing among the living.\n",
            "And I was struggling to figure out how to carry the imprints of this experience.\n",
            "Out of my group of 10 cancer comrades, as we called each other --\n",
            "young people who I’d befriended during those years in treatment -- only two of us were still alive.\n",
            "So I knew how lucky I was to be alive, I knew that ...\n",

            "you know, what was the point of having endured all that I'd endured if not to live a good life, a meaningful life,\n",
            "a beautiful one? But I didn't have the tools to do that. And without, you know, a cavalry of doctors and nurses\n",
            "and friends checking up on me, I realized, you know, there was no road map for the way forward\n",
            "and that I was going to have to create one for myself. And so I spent this lost year trying and failing\n",
            "and trying and failing to move on, only to realize, you know,\n",
            "that we don't get to move on from the painful parts of our past.\n",
            "As much as we want to, you know, we can't compartmentalize them and stow them away\n",
            "because they always bob back up to the surface and often with a vengeance,\n",
            "and that instead I was going to have to figure out how to move forward with the imprints of my illness,\n",
            "both on my body and on my mind. And so one of the very first things I did,\n",
            "because I was still in a place of feeling afraid, feeling, you know, ironically,\n",
            "afraid of the outside world. I was comfortable in the hospital ecosystem\n",
            "to really, first of all, give myself the time to properly heal from that experience,\n",
            "but also to figure out what was on the other side of that fear. And so I learned how to drive,\n",
            "and I ended up returning to some of the letters\n",
            "I'd received from readers of \"Life, Interrupted,\" who had shared with me their own experiences of aftermath,\n",
            "of figuring out how to do the hard work of recovery\n",
            "and figuring out how to do that hard work of moving forward,\n",
            "with whatever had happened. And so I decided to sublet my apartment.\n",
            "I borrowed a friend's car. I got a bunch of camping gear, and I embarked on a different kind of 100-day project.\n",
            "A 100-day, 15,000-mile solo road trip with my dog Oscar as my co-pilot,\n",
            "and to visit some of these strangers who had been lifelines\n",
            "when I was at my sickest, and to talk to them about that experience of in-betweenness.\n",
            "So to wrap this up, the title of the book, \"Between Two Kingdoms,\" is a reference to Susan Sontag's essay \"Illness as Metaphor,\"\n",
            "where she describes how we all have dual citizenship in the kingdom of the sick\n",
            "and in the kingdom of the well, and that it's only a matter of time until we use that other passport.\n",
            "But what she didn't talk about was that liminal space between the two,\n",
            "where maybe you're not either sick or well. And that became the premise of that book.\n",
            "It's figuring out how to exist in the messy middle. SZ: That book launched during COVID.\n",
            "Something else that was beginning at that time was the \"Isolation Journals\"\n",

            "as the world was shutting down, as we were all having to pivot and to put our plans on hold\n",
            "and to figure out how to live our lives\n",
            "within very, you know, major constraints.\n",
            "So much of that experience felt bizarrely familiar to me. Everything from wearing a face mask and, you know,\n",
            "walking around with gallons of hand sanitizer to being isolated at home.\n",
            "And, you know, isolation is its own epidemic,\n",

            "called \"The Isolation Journals.\" It's a free newsletter, and we invited our larger community to do their own 100-day project.\n",

            "One of my very favorite essays and prompts came from Lou Sullivan, a seven-year-old, two-time brain cancer survivor\n",

            "And within 48 hours, we had over 40,000 people who'd signed up.\n",

            "We have over 150,000 community members. And every Sunday we send out a newsletter\n",
            "with thoughts from me and then a new essay and journaling prompt.\n",

            "Some people reinterpret the idea of journaling, not as old fashioned, you know, pen and paper,\n",
            "but they'll paint to the prompts, they'll do modern dances. And so it's really been such a nourishing,\n",

            "and investing your time and energy in that. And so luckily, by the time that I did have my recurrence,\n",
            "I had spent that decade building a community, because as much of a cliche as it sounds like,\n",
            "we all need a village and we especially need a village when the ceiling caves in.\n",
            "And so, when I learned of my recurrence, Jon was in the midst\n",
            "of perhaps his busiest professional season of life.\n",
            "And I’ve known Jon from the time I was 13 years old. I have watched him work so hard\n",
            "to get to a place where he was getting the kind of recognition and invitations that he had,\n",
            "and it felt really important to me that he not put his life on pause. And so we had to get creative about how to stay connected to each other\n",
            "at this time where it felt like we were living on polar opposite planets.\n",
            "And so Jon came up with a beautiful idea of composing lullabies.\n",
            "He would compose a lullaby for me every single day, and send it off to me as a kind of counterpoint\n",
            "to the hospital's many noises, the beeping of monitors, the wheezing of respirators, the alarms that go off.\n",
            "And it was his way of enveloping me with his presence,\n",
            "even when he couldn't physically be there. And I, in turn, would text him photos of the little paintings that I would make.\n",
            "And so what that meant was that when we spoke on the phone, the conversation wasn't just centered around the latest biopsy results\n",
            "and blood tests and whatever else was happening. It was centered in our love language, which is a shared creative language,\n",
            "and gave us a way of expressing what we couldn't express.\n",
            "SZ: Joey writes, \"What do you recommend to someone who is trying to get started with journaling\n",
            "but feeling a little overwhelmed by the blank page? Do you have any rituals or any starting places you can recommend?\"\n",
            "SJ: Yes, in spite of the fact that I've been a lifelong journaler, I go through many moments where I feel daunted by the blank page,\n",
            "and that was kind of the original premise of starting the \"Isolation Journals.\" Sometimes we need to read something.\n",
            "Sometimes we need to prompt ourselves to get out of, you know,\n",
            "to twist our mind out of its usual rut.\n",
            "Come join us at \"The Isolation Journals.\" We have an archive of hundreds of essays and prompts and journaling challenges.\n",
            "Or don't. But I'll offer you what helps me\n",
            "when I'm feeling daunted by the blank page. And it's actually something I borrowed from my friend,\n",
            "the poet Marie Howe, and she told me that when she's feeling stuck,\n",
            "she writes with her non-dominant hand and a big scrawl across the page.\n",
            "\"I don't want to write about ...\" And then she writes into that.\n",
            "Another one of my favorite journaling prompts from \"The Isolation Journals\" is by the photographer Ash Parsons.\n",
            "During a period of time where she was in the NICU with a recently adopted baby who was having major health issues,\n",
            "she began what she calls “just 10 images,” which is listing just 10 snapshots from the last 24 hours,\n",
            "stream of consciousness, whatever comes to mind. And I love that prompt because it's in list form and it's so simple.\n",
            "But more than just recounting what happens in the last 24 hours,\n",
            "it's a prompt that's trained me to look and to look again\n",
            "and to notice my day differently. But the beautiful thing about journaling,\n",
            "and the thing that makes it so generative and inspiring for me is how low the barrier to entry is.\n",
            "You know, journaling is not beautiful writing. It doesn't have to be grammatically correct.\n",
            "It doesn’t have to be in full sentences. It can be whatever it is that you want. It's such an expansive form that you can interpret\n",
            "and reinterpret however it best serves you. SZ: I have one last question from York.\n",
            "York says, \"Thank you for sharing your experience and insights. One of the parts that resonated with me was your experience of using creativity\n",
            "while you were struggling with finding purpose. Were you always able to focus on creativity and if not,\n",
            "what helped you make that shift?\" SJ: Liz Gilbert speaks so beautifully\n",
            "about the pressure of finding\n",
            "your “capital P” Purpose. And so, what she's always said is you have to be one percent more curious than afraid.\n",
            "Any time I come up with some big, ambitious creative project,\n",
            "I immediately get frozen in my fear and daunted by whatever it is.\n",
            "And so I think curiosity is such a gentler way in and such ...\n",
            "And it's a more honest way into the creative process, where you don't hold to an expectation\n",
            "of how something should look or how something will come together.\n",
            "But you really give yourself the time and space to explore the threads of that curiosity.\n",
            "The work I'm most proud of, the work that has surprised me\n",
            "and changed me as an artist, as a writer, are the projects I started without that sense of output\n",
            "or expectation, be it, you know, that 100-day project and keeping that journal\n",
            "or even the paintings that I started doing in the hospital.\n",
            "They were pure play and tapping into that sort of child space,\n",
            "of creating simply for the joy of creating without any regard for if it's good or bad,\n",
            "but simply to explore. And so I try to trick myself back into that space all the time.\n",

            "How can you all say what you mean\n",
            "without being mean?\n",
            "I started thinking about this back in 1999.\n",
            "I had started a software company,\n",
            "and I came into the office one day,\n",
            "and about half the people in the company\n",
            "had sent me the same article\n",
            "about how everyone would rather have a boss\n",
            "who is really mean\n",
            "but competent,\n",
            "a total jerk, but competent,\n",
            "than one who is really nice but incompetent.\n",
            "And I thought, \"Gosh,\n",
            "are they sending me this because they think I'm a jerk\n",
            "or because they think I'm incompetent?\"\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "And surely, those are not my only two choices.\n",
            "Now, I went to business school\n",
            "and there, I learned exactly nothing about management.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "But I did learn one really important thing.\n",
            "All of life's hardest problems can be solved\n",
            "with a good two-by-two framework.\n",
            "So that is how I started thinking about this problem.\n",
            "I was unwilling to let go of my desire to show that I cared personally.\n",
            "That is what, for me, gave work meaning.\n",
            "But I also had to learn how to challenge directly,\n",
            "and I had to learn how to do both at the same time.\n",
            "And over time,\n",
            "I came to think about caring and challenging at the same time\n",
            "as radical candor.\n",
            "Now, the easiest way to understand what radical candor is,\n",
            "is to think about what happens\n",
            "when we mess up on one dimension or another,\n",
            "as we are all bound to do from time to time.\n",
            "Sometimes we remember to challenge directly,\n",
            "but we forget to show that we care personally.\n",
            "And this I call obnoxious aggression.”\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Anybody ever seen any obnoxious aggression?\n",
            "And this is a problem.\n",
            "Obnoxious aggression is a problem because it hurts people.\n",
            "Primarily, it's a problem because it hurts people.\n",
            "But it's also a problem because it's inefficient.\n",
            "If I act like a total jerk to you,\n",
            "then you're likely to go into fight-or-flight mode in your brain,\n",
            "and then you literally cannot hear what I'm saying.\n",
            "So I'm just wasting my breath.\n",
            "And then there's a third,\n",
            "more subtle problem with obnoxious aggression.\n",
            "I don't know about you, but for me,\n",
            "when I realize I've acted like a jerk,\n",
            "it is not my instinct to go the right way on \"care personally.\"\n",
            "Instead, it's my instinct to go the wrong way on \"challenge directly.\"\n",
            "\"Oh, it's no big deal. It doesn't really matter.\"\n",
            "And then I wind up in the worst place of all -- “manipulative insincerity.”\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "If obnoxious aggression is front-stabbing,\n",
            "manipulative insincerity is back-stabbing.\n",
            "It's passive aggressive behavior.\n",
            "This is where all the most toxic kinds of workplace behavior or frankly,\n",
            "behavior at home in any relationship that you have in any part of your life,\n",
            "creep in.\n",
            "And it is fun to tell stories about obnoxious aggression\n",
            "and manipulative insincerity,\n",
            "because this is where the drama is.\n",
            "However, the vast majority of us\n",
            "make the vast majority of our mistakes in this last quadrant\n",
            "where we do remember to show that we care personally.\n",
            "Because you know what?\n",
            "Most people are actually pretty nice people.\n",
            "So we do remember to show that we care personally,\n",
            "but we're so worried about not hurting someone's feelings\n",
            "or not offending someone\n",
            "that we fail to tell them something\n",
            "they'd be better off knowing in the long run.\n",
            "And this is what I call “ruinous empathy.”\n",

            "In order to explain to you what I mean by this,\n",
            "I want to tell you a story about possibly the most painful moment of my career.\n",
            "I had just hired this person, Alex.\n",
            "We'll call this person Alex.\n",
            "And I liked Alex a lot.\n",
            "Alex was smart,\n",
            "Alex was charming, Alex was funny.\n",
            "Alex would do stuff like,\n",
            "we’re at a manager offsite playing one of those endless get-to-know-you games.\n",
            "And Alex was the person who had the courage to raise their hand\n",
            "and to say, \"I can tell that everyone is really stressed out.\n",
            "I've got an idea.\n",
            "It’ll help us get to know each other better,\n",
            "and it'll be really fast.\"\n",
            "Whatever Alex's idea was, if it was fast, we were down with it.\n",
            "Alex says, \"Let's just go around the table\n",
            "and confess what candy our parents used when potty-training us.\"\n",
            "Really weird, but really fast.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Weirder yet, we all remembered -- Hershey Kisses right here.\n",
            "And then for the next ten months,\n",
            "every time there was a tense moment in a meeting,\n",
            "Alex would whip out just the right piece of candy\n",
            "for the right person at the right moment.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "So Alex brought a little levity to the office.\n",
            "Everybody loved working with Alex.\n",
            "One problem with Alex.\n",
            "Alex was doing terrible work.\n",
            "Absolutely terrible.\n",
            "Sort of creative and unusual, but tons of sloppy mistakes.\n",
            "I was so puzzled.\n",
            "I couldn't understand what was going on,\n",
            "because Alex had this incredible resume, this great history of accomplishments.\n",
            "I learned much later that Alex was smoking pot\n",
            "in the bathroom three times a day,\n",
            "which maybe explained all that candy that he had.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "But I didn't know any of that at the time.\n",
            "All I knew is that Alex would hand stuff in to me\n",
            "with shame in his eyes.\n",
            "He knew his work wasn't nearly good enough,\n",
            "and I would say something to him along the lines of,\n",
            "\"Oh, Alex, you're so smart,\n",
            "you're so awesome, everybody loves working with you.\n",
            "This is a great start.\n",
            "Maybe you can make it just a little bit better.\"\n",
            "Which, of course, he never did.\n",
            "OK, so let's pause for a moment.\n",
            "What was going on there?\n",
            "Part of it was truly ruinous empathy.\n",
            "I really did like Alex,\n",
            "and I really did not want to hurt his feelings.\n",
            "But if I'm honest with myself,\n",
            "there was something more insidious going on as well,\n",
            "because Alex was popular and Alex was sensitive,\n",
            "and there was part of me that was afraid\n",
            "that if I told Alex in no uncertain terms that his work wasn't nearly good enough,\n",
            "he would get upset, he might even start to cry.\n",
            "And then everyone would think I was a big you-know-what.\n",
            "And so the part of me that was worried about my reputation as a leader,\n",
            "that was the manipulative insincerity part.\n",
            "The part of me that was worried about Alex's feelings,\n",
            "that was the ruinous empathy part.\n",
            "So this kind of toxic mixture goes on for about ten months,\n",
            "and eventually the inevitable happens.\n",
            "And I realize that if I don't fire Alex,\n",
            "I'm going to lose all my best performers,\n",
            "because not only have I been unfair to Alex\n",
            "not to tell him so that he could fix things,\n",
            "I've been unfair to the whole team.\n",
            "Their deliverables were late because his deliverables were late.\n",
            "They couldn’t spend as much time on their work as they needed to\n",
            "because they were constantly having to redo his work.\n",
            "And the people who were the best performers on my team,\n",
            "they were just going to quit.\n",
            "They wanted to be able to work at a place where they could do their best work.\n",
            "And so I sat down to have a conversation with Alex\n",
            "that I should have started, frankly, 10 months previously.\n",
            "And when I finished explaining to him where things stood,\n",
            "he kind of pushed his chair back from the table,\n",
            "he looked me right in the eye and he said, \"Why didn't you tell me?\"\n",
            "And as that question was going around in my head with no good answer,\n",
            "he looked at me again and he said, \"Why didn't anyone tell me?\n",
            "I thought you all cared about me.\"\n",
            "And now I realized that by not telling Alex,\n",
            "thinking I was being so nice sparing his feelings,\n",
            "he's now getting fired as a result of it.\n",
            "Not so nice after all.\n",
            "It was a terrible moment in my career,\n",
            "but it was too late to save Alex.\n",
            "Even Alex at this point agreed he should go\n",
            "because his reputation on the team was just shot.\n",
            "All I could do in that moment was make myself a very solemn promise\n",
            "that I would never make that mistake again,\n",
            "and that I would do everything in my power\n",
            "to help other people avoid making that mistake.\n",
            "And that is why I'm here, talking to you all today.\n",
            "Now I want to talk to you not only about how this works,\n",
            "how ruinous empathy works in one-on-one relationships.\n",
            "It also works on team culture, or doesn’t work.\n",
            "Often, I’ll work with a team, and they start out radically candid.\n",
            "Small group of people, they know each other really well.\n",
            "It’s kind of easy for them to show they care and challenge.\n",
            "nd then because of that, they find some success and they grow,\n",
            "and then they succumb to the gravitational pull of ruinous empathy,\n",
            "and then things start going wrong.\n",
            "But nobody wants to be mean,\n",
            "nobody wants to talk to anybody else, everybody's getting really agitated.\n",
            "And then finally somebody bursts out and says the thing.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Anybody ever see that happen?\n",
            "Maybe not in the best way, but it works.\n",
            "And because it works, they do it again, but maybe they do it a little more.\n",
            "And because everybody else is so determined to be nice,\n",
            "they say things like, \"Oh, she didn't mean any harm,\"\n",
            "or, \"Oh, he's a good guy.\"\n",
            "And then, the next thing you know, this person is promoted now.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Anybody ever see this happen?\n",
            "There comes a moment on every team's history\n",
            "when the jerks begin to win,\n",
            "and that is when the culture begins to lose.\n",
            "Because what happens next?\n",
            "Everybody moves down to manipulative insincerity.\n",
            "They're talking badly about this person behind this person's back,\n",
            "but they are not talking to the person.\n",
            "It does not have to be this way, folks.\n",
            "If you notice this happening,\n",
            "your team sort of drifting over to ruinous empathy,\n",
            "it's possible to move over to radical candor.\n",
            "That's not going to solve all problems.\n",
            "People will still make a mistake,\n",
            "but you can tell them about that mistake in a way\n",
            "that allows them to make things better.\n",
            "Now, it's not only the culture on teams where this happens.\n",
            "Sometimes it happens in a whole society.\n",
            "Sometimes it turns out that a whole society is polarized.\n",
            "Did anybody ever know such such a society?\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "We’re polarized, and we’re not talking to each other.\n",
            "We're talking about each other,\n",
            "and we're sticking with the people who agree with us.\n",
            "And I am no better than the rest of us on this.\n",
            "I recently was invited to give a talk at a company\n",
            "whose policies I disagreed with pretty vehemently,\n",
            "and I was tempted not to go.\n",
            "And then I thought, that does not seem like it's in the spirit of radical candor.\n",
            "In fact, I believe very deeply\n",
            "that unchallenged beliefs become prejudices.\n",
            "So I needed to go to this place and talk to these people,\n",
            "not because I was going in prepared to change my mind,\n",
            "if I'm honest, I was not.\n",
            "But I also wasn't going in trying to change their mind.\n",
            "I was going in thinking if I understand their point of view,\n",
            "it will help me deepen my thinking\n",
            "and maybe I can find some common ground with these people.\n",
            "You're going to hear more about common ground.\n",
            "Maybe I can learn to like these people.\n",
            "And as I gave the talk, I got to the Q-and-A and it was going really well.\n",
            "We were having a great conversation,\n",
            "and there was this voice inside my head,\n",
            "like screaming at me, saying,\n",
            "\"Kim, these people are not your enemies.\n",
            "These are your fellow Americans.\"\n",
            "And it really made me take a deep breath.\n",
            "I was like, why would I not have come to speak with these people?\n",
            "After the conference was over,\n",
            "somebody came up to me and said,\n",
            "\"Kim, do you believe this, do you believe that?\"\n",
            "I said, yes, I did.\n",
            "And they kind of cocked their head and they said, \"Huh.\n",
            "You don't seem like an evil person.\"\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",

            "What modern archeology tells us, for example,\n",
            "is that there were already cities\n",
            "on the lower reaches of the Yellow River\n",
            "over 1,000 years before the rise of the Shang.\n",
            "And on the other side of the Pacific,\n",
            "in Peru’s Rio Supe,\n",
            "we already see huge agglomerations of people\n",
            "with monumental architecture 4,000 years before the Inca.\n",
            "In South Asia, 4,500 years ago,\n",
            "the first cities appeared at places like Mohenjo-daro\n",
            "and Harappa in the Indus Valley.\n",
            "But these huge settlements present no evidence of kings or queens.\n",
            "No royal monuments, no aggrandizing art.\n",
            "And what's more, we know that much of the population\n",
            "lived in high-quality housing with excellent sanitation.\n",
            "North of the Black Sea,\n",
            "in the modern country of Ukraine,\n",
            "archaeologists have found evidence of even more ancient cities\n",
            "going back 6,000 years.\n",
            "And again,\n",
            "these huge settlements present no evidence\n",
            "of authoritarian rule.\n",
            "No temples, no palaces,\n",
            "not even any evidence of central storage facilities\n",
            "or top-down bureaucracy.\n",
            "Actually what we see in those cases are these great concentric rings of houses\n",
            "arranged rather like the inside of a tree trunk\n",
            "around neighborhood assembly halls.\n",
            "And it stayed that way for about 800 years.\n",
            "So what this means is that long before the birth of democracy in ancient Greece,\n",
            "there were already well-organized cities\n",
            "on several of the world's continents\n",
            "which present no evidence for ruling dynasties.\n",
            "And some of them also seem to have managed perfectly well without priests,\n",
            "mandarins and warrior politicians.\n",
            "Of course, some early cities did go on\n",
            "to become the capitals of kingdoms and empires.\n",
            "But it's important to note that others went\n",
            "in completely the opposite direction.\n",
            "To take one well-documented example,\n",
            "around the year 250 AD,\n",
            "the city of Teotihuacan, in the valley of Mexico,\n",
            "with a population of around 100,000 people,\n",
            "turned its back on pyramid temples and human sacrifices\n",
            "and reconstituted itself\n",
            "as a vast collection of comfortable villas housing most of the city's population.\n",
            "When archaeologists first investigated these buildings,\n",
            "they assumed they were palaces.\n",
            "Then they realized that just about everyone in the city\n",
            "was living in a palace with spacious patios\n",
            "and subfloor drainages,\n",
            "gorgeous murals on the walls.\n",
            "But we shouldn't get carried away.\n",
            "None of the societies that I've been describing\n",
            "was perfectly egalitarian.\n",
            "But then we might also remember that fifth-century Athens,\n",
            "which we look to as the birthplace of democracy,\n",
            "was also a militaristic society founded on chattel slavery,\n",
            "where women were completely excluded from politics.\n",
            "So maybe by comparison,\n",
            "somewhere like Teotihuacan was not doing so badly\n",
            "at keeping the genie of inequality in its bottle.\n",
            "But maybe we can just forget about all that, we can look away.\n",
            "Perhaps all of these things I'm talking about are basically outliers.\n",
            "Maybe we can still keep our familiar story of civilization intact.\n",
            "And after all,\n",
            "if cities without rulers were really such a common thing in human history,\n",
            "why didn't Cortéz and Pizarro and all the other conquistadors\n",
            "find any when they began their invasion of the Americas?\n",
            "Why did they find only Moctezuma and Atahualpa\n",
            "lording it over their empires?\n",
            "Except that's not true either.\n",
            "Actually, the city where Hernan Cortéz found his military allies,\n",
            "the ones who enabled his successful assault\n",
            "on the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán,\n",
            "was exactly one such city without rulers:\n",
            "an indigenous republic by the name of Tlaxcala,\n",
            "governed by an urban parliament,\n",
            "which had some pretty interesting initiation rituals\n",
            "for would-be politicians.\n",
            "They'd be periodically whipped\n",

            "But we're not necessarily living.\n",

            "we keep ourselves so busy and distracted to begin with.\n",
            "But we don't know what to do about it.\n",
            "So I'm here to tell you I figured out what to do about it.\n",

            "we often use the word \"fun\" to describe anything we do with our leisure time,\n",
            "even if it's not actually enjoyable, and, in fact, a waste of time.\n",
            "So for example, we scroll through social media \"for fun,\"\n",
            "even though doing so often makes us feel bad about, like, kind of everything.\n",
            "Or we'll say, \"That was so fun. We should do that again soon\" --\n",

            "Instead, fun is the secret to feeling alive.\n",
            "So today, I want to propose to you\n",
            "a new, more precise definition of what fun is.\n",

            "So the first thing we need to start with\n",
            "is the fact that fun is a feeling, and it's not an activity.\n",
            "And that's important,\n",
            "because a lot of times, when I ask people what's fun,\n",
            "they'll respond with a list of activities that they enjoy.\n",
            "You know, they'll say, \"Dancing is fun,\" or \"Skiing is fun,\" or, I don't know,\n",

            "and an activity that seems like it would be fun\n",
            "doesn't end up feeling fun.\n",
            "And then on the flip side,\n",
            "we've had experiences where something that doesn't seem like it'll be fun at all\n",
            "ends up feeling ridiculously fun.\n",
            "There's an element of serendipity.\n",
            "But when people do have fun,\n",
            "when they experience this feeling,\n",
            "it's actually very easy to recognize,\n",
            "because people who are having fun\n",
            "look like they're being illuminated from within.\n",
            "So, for example,\n",
            "here is me and my husband having fun together.\n",
            "Here are some presidents having fun together.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Here’s Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the Dalai Lama having fun together.\n",

            "(Laughter)\n",
            "And as you can see in these photographs,\n",
            "true fun produces this visceral sense of lightness and joy.\n",
            "It's radiant.\n",
            "In fact, when I asked my daughter, when she was about five years old,\n",
            "what color fun would be,\n",
            "she said \"sunshine.\"\n",
            "So what is this sunshine?\n",
            "You know? What is this feeling that we call \"fun\"?\n",
            "When people tell me their stories about fun,\n",
            "it's really interesting, because the details are all different,\n",
            "and often quite mundane,\n",
            "but the energy running through them is the same.\n",
            "There were three factors that are consistently present,\n",
            "to the point that I believe they constitute a new definition,\n",
            "one that is a lot more accurate than what's in the dictionary.\n",
            "And those three factors are playfulness, connection and flow.\n",
            "So by playfulness,\n",
            "I do not mean you have to play games,\n",
            "or, God forbid, make believe.\n",
            "I just mean having a lighthearted attitude\n",
            "of doing things for the sake of doing them\n",
            "and not caring too much about the outcome.\n",
            "Letting go of perfectionism.\n",
            "When we have fun, our guard is down,\n",
            "and we're not taking ourselves too seriously.\n",
            "Connection refers to the feeling of having a special, shared experience.\n",
            "And I do think it's possible, in some circumstances,\n",
            "to have fun alone,\n",
            "and for this feeling of connection to be with yourself or the surroundings,\n",
            "or the activity.\n",
            "But in the majority of stories that people tell me\n",
            "about their peak fun memories,\n",
            "another person is involved.\n",
            "And that's true even for introverts.\n",
            "And then flow is the state where we are so engaged and focused\n",
            "on whatever we're doing\n",
            "that we can even lose track of time.\n",
            "You can think about an athlete in the middle of a game,\n",
            "or a musician playing a piece of music.\n",
            "It's when we're in the zone.\n",
            "It's possible to be in flow and not have fun,\n",
            "like if you're arguing,\n",
            "but you cannot have fun if you're not in flow.\n",
            "So playfulness, connection and flow all feel great on their own.\n",
            "But when we experience all three at once,\n",
            "something magical happens.\n",
            "We have fun.\n",
            "And that doesn't just feel good,\n",
            "it is good for us.\n",
            "In fact, fun does so many amazingly good things for us\n",
            "that I personally believe that fun is not just the result of human thriving,\n",
            "it's a cause.\n",
            "So, for example, fun is energizing.\n",
            "When people tell me their stories about fun, they glow.\n",
            "It is like a fire has been lit inside of them,\n",
            "and the energy and the warmth that they give off is contagious.\n",
            "You know, so much of life drains us,\n",
            "but fun fills us up.\n",
            "Fun also makes us present.\n",
            "A lot of us put a lot of work into trying to be more present --\n",
            "we do yoga classes, we meditate, and that is all great,\n",
            "but the fact that fun is a flow state means that when we are having fun,\n",
            "we simply are present.\n",
            "There's no other way for it to happen.\n",
            "Fun also unites us.\n",
            "We live in a really polarized world,\n",
            "and as we all know, there's a lot of very serious problems.\n",
            "But when we have fun with people,\n",
            "we don't see them as different political parties,\n",
            "or nationalities or religions.\n",
            "We connect with them as human beings,\n",
            "and it's worth noting that that is the first step\n",
            "in being able to work together to solve those problems.\n",
            "Fun also makes us healthier.\n",
            "Being lonely and stressed out,\n",
            "as many of us have been for the past two years,\n",
            "causes hormonal changes in our bodies that increase our risks for disease.\n",
            "But when we have fun,\n",
            "we're relaxed and we're more socially connected,\n",
            "both of which have the opposite effect.\n",
            "So, kind of blows my mind every time I think about it this way,\n",
            "but having fun is a health intervention.\n",
            "And then, lastly, fun is joyful.\n",
            "You know, we all so desperately want to be happy.\n",
            "We read books about happiness,\n",
            "we download apps about happiness,\n",
            "but when we are in a moment of having fun, we are happy.\n",
            "So it makes me think that, perhaps,\n",
            "the secret to long-term happiness\n",
            "is just to have more everyday moments of fun.\n",
            "So how do we do that?\n",
            "How do we have more fun?\n",
            "Well, to start with,\n",
            "do not take the suggestions you'll find in magazine articles\n",
            "about how to have more fun.\n",
            "I looked at some of these myself,\n",
            "and I found suggestions that include -- and I'm not making these up --\n",
            "\"roast a turkey.\"\n",

            "\"Put together an altar to loved ones who have passed.\"\n",

            "\"Adorn your table with gourds.\"\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Those are not good suggestions.\n",
            "Instead, the most effective thing you can do to have more fun\n",
            "is to focus on its ingredients, by which I mean,\n",
            "do everything you can to fill your life with more moments of playfulness,\n",
            "connection and flow.\n",
            "So here are some ideas for how to do so.\n",
            "To start with, reduce distractions in order to increase flow.\n",
            "Anything that distracts you is going to kick you out of flow\n",
            "and prevent you from having fun.\n",

            "for most of us, these days?\n",
            "Oh, thank you.\n",
            "(Laughs)\n",
            "It was rhetorical, but yes, your phones.\n",
            "(Laughs)\n",
            "I wrote a book called \"How to Break Up With Your Phone,\"\n",
            "so I have strong feelings about this,\n",
            "but I can guarantee you that you are not going to have fun\n",
            "if you're constantly on your phone.\n",
            "So today, I want to challenge you to keep your phone out of your hand\n",
            "as much as possible,\n",
            "so you can take me up on my second suggestion,\n",
            "which is to increase connection\n",
            "by interacting more with other human beings in real life.\n",
            "Now, I know that one of the main reasons we're constantly on our phones\n",
            "is specifically to avoid having to spend time\n",
            "and interact with other human beings in real life.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "So I want to assure you that it is worth it,\n",
            "and it is not as hard as it might seem.\n",
            "So here's how you do it.\n",
            "You start by making eye contact with someone.\n",
            "Like, look them in the eye,\n",
            "don't look in the middle of their forehead,\n",
            "where the camera would be on a Zoom call.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "And you say “Hello.”\n",
            "And if that goes well, you can introduce yourself.\n",
            "And if that goes well,\n",

            "Would it be OK or would it get all screwed up?\n",

            "an entirely unrelated global calamity\n",

            "and tell the other person\n",

            "because they should care about that instead.\n",
            "That world would suck, right?\n",
            "Like, your sister borrows five dollars from you,\n",

            "when the polar ice caps are melting?\"\n",
            "No one wants to live in this world, right?\n",
            "Kant also says, by the way,\n",
            "that you should treat people as ends in themselves,\n",
            "and not a means to an end,\n",
            "meaning, you shouldn't use people to get what you want.\n",
            "Well, that's what I was doing.\n",
            "I also learned about Aristotle and the study of virtue ethics.\n",
            "So Aristotle says there's certain qualities we should all have.\n",
            "Things like generosity and courage\n",
            "and friendliness and mildness,\n",
            "and he wants us to practice them every day\n",
            "so that we not only have them,\n",
            "we have them in the exact right amount.\n",
            "We don't have a deficiency of them,\n",
            "and we don't have an excess of them.\n",
            "Now virtue ethics can be kind of, maddeningly imprecise,\n",
            "but at the very least, it was pretty clear that I was exhibiting an excess of anger\n",
            "and maybe a deficiency of friendliness.\n",
            "I wasn't nailing it, is the point.\n",
            "Like, I definitely was not getting it exactly right.\n",
            "Then I learned about utilitarianism,\n",
            "made famous by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill.\n",
            "And this one actually gave me a shred of hope\n",
            "that I was doing something good,\n",
            "because utilitarians only care about the results of our actions,\n",
            "they only care that we are creating more happiness and pleasure\n",
            "than we are pain and suffering.\n",
            "So yes, I'm being obnoxious and moralistic,\n",
            "and I hand it to this guy, causing him some amount of pain,\n",
            "but an enormous amount of money\n",
            "is going to be given to people in great need.\n",
            "So the amount of happiness I’m creating\n",
            "outweighs the amount of pain and suffering.\n",
            "But the utilitarians also said\n",
            "that when we're calculating the amount of happiness\n",
            "or pain we've created,\n",
            "we can't just think about the one person we're dealing with,\n",
            "we have to think about the fact that everybody in our society\n",
            "will now both know this happened\n",
            "and will fear that it could someday happen to them.\n",
            "And since we've already seen what a terrible, stinky world\n",
            "I was trying to create,\n",
            "everyone in our society would become a little bit bummed out and sad\n",
            "by what I did,\n",
            "and so the total amount of pain and suffering I've created\n",
            "might actually outweigh the happiness.\n",
            "I never got a straightforward answer, obviously,\n",
            "because Aristotle never wrote\n",
            "about, like, fender benders involving horse-drawn carriages\n",
            "in ancient Athens.\n",
            "But at the very least,\n",
            "it sure felt like Jeremy Bentham\n",
            "and John Stuart Mill would be a little disappointed in me.\n",
            "And it sure felt like Aristotle would be a little annoyed,\n",
            "and it sure felt like Immanuel Kant would wave a disapproving finger at me.\n",
            "And if all of the world's greatest philosophers\n",

            "and it lets you have more flights.\n",
            "Now historically, rockets have been used once, and then that’s it.\n",
            "But if you think about it,\n",
            "would you ever build an airplane,\n",
            "fly it once\n",
            "and then throw it away?\n",
            "Like, no, that’s ridiculous,\n",
            "because the cost of each flight would be way too high,\n",
            "and you wouldn’t have very many flights, right?\n",
            "So let’s put this in perspective a little bit.\n",
            "So think about the last rover that we just sent to Mars.\n",
            "It is an amazing mission;\n",
            "it’s still on Mars collecting great data.\n",
            "So the launch cost for that mission was 243 million dollars.\n",
            "So that works out to be about 100,000 dollars per pound\n",
            "to launch that rover to Mars.\n",
            "And that’s where we are today.\n",
            "So SpaceX is aiming to have a launch cost for Starship\n",
            "on the order of a couple million dollars.\n",
            "And so that means that you could launch that same Mars rover\n",
            "for about 900 dollars per pound.\n",
            "So that’s 100,000 dollars versus 900 dollars.\n",
            "That’s a huge difference.\n",
            "And actually, it's probably cheaper than that\n",
            "because you could fit like 100 of those Mars rovers inside one Starship\n",
            "because it’s just that big.\n",
            "It’s really incredible.\n",
            "And it’s not just SpaceX.\n",
            "There are multiple commercial companies building new rockets now\n",
            "of all different sizes,\n",
            "for all different purposes.\n",
            "And this is great because this is really helping to open up space to more people.\n",
            "So here’s an image of some of the current rockets\n",
            "compared to NASA’s mighty Saturn V rocket.\n",
            "So the Saturn V is the rocket that launched astronauts to the Moon\n",
            "in the ’60s and ’70s.\n",
            "The last Saturn V launched in 1973.\n",
            "And full disclosure,\n",
            "I was not even born yet,\n",
            "so I think this is incredibly unfair\n",
            "because there has never been a rocket more powerful since.\n",
            "So I just have to emphasize\n",
            "that the changes we’re talking about today,\n",
            "these are not incremental, small advances in rocketry and spacecraft.\n",
            "These are truly transformational technologies\n",
            "that are giving us completely new capabilities\n",
            "and changing the paradigm for space exploration.\n",
            "And what’s really going to happen\n",
            "is we’re going to move from where we are today,\n",
            "which is usually, you know,\n",
            "more specialized, one-off, boutique-style missions\n",
            "into more mass-produced, large-scale operations in space.\n",
            "And the reason is because we are being largely freed\n",
            "of these traditional, very severe mass and cost restraints\n",
            "that we’ve been working under in the aerospace industry for decades.\n",
            "Now there is one vehicle that’s really forced us\n",
            "to change the conversation regarding space exploration\n",
            "and space architectures,\n",
            "and that is the Starship.\n",
            "That entire system is designed\n",
            "to be even more powerful than the Saturn V.\n",
            "And the Starship vehicle itself\n",
            "will be able to launch over 100 metric tons of payload\n",
            "to Earth orbit,\n",
            "to the surface of the Moon,\n",
            "to the surface of Mars\n",
            "and even beyond.\n",
            "Like, 100 metric tons of payload.\n",
            "Like, that’s crazy.\n",
            "That is a crazy number\n",
            "that we would never have been discussing a while ago\n",
            "because in spaceflight,\n",
            "we are always trying to reduce mass, right?\n",
            "Miniaturize your components,\n",
            "have your instruments be as lightweight as possible\n",
            "because of the mass and cost constraints.\n",
            "And so now we actually have the opposite problem\n",
            "where we have to figure out, like --\n",
            "how are we going to fill 100 metric tons of payload?\n",
            "Like, seriously, like, what are we going to fly?\n",
            "So this is a great place to be,\n",
            "and it’s a great problem to have.\n",
            "How can you actually fly such a ridiculous amount of payload into the solar system?\n",
            "Well, Starship will conveniently refill its propellant tanks in space\n",
            "with methane and oxygen.\n",
            "So the way that this works is you launch your first Starship, right?\n",
            "You’ve got your payload you want to send wherever into the solar system.\n",
            "You launch that into orbit.\n",
            "Then you launch another Starship,\n",
            "and we’ll just call it a tanker because it’s basically just another Starship,\n",
            "but it’s full of propellant.\n",
            "And then those two vehicles meet\n",
            "and they dock in Earth orbit.\n",
            "And the tanker refills the propellant tanks of your starship.\n",
            "So essentially what you’re doing\n",
            "is you’re refilling your gas tanks before you go out on a big, long trip.\n",
            "And that’s how you can send so much payload capacity\n",
            "out into the solar system.\n",
            "Now this is so important\n",
            "because Earth is such a large gravity well.\n",
            "It just takes so much energy,\n",
            "and hence, so much fuel,\n",
            "just to launch off the surface of the Earth.\n",
            "So by refilling the tanks in space,\n",
            "we’re essentially resetting the rocket equation in orbit,\n",
            "and then we can send these payloads out to wherever they need to go.\n",
            "So this is fantastic.\n",
            "Like, we have this new capability\n",
            "and this is how it works,\n",
            "but now I’d like to go to the really exciting part:\n",
            "What are we going to do with this capability?\n",
            "So consider this.\n",
            "Scientists, myself included,\n",
            "have long been interested in the possibility of life on Europa.\n",
            "Europa has a subsurface --\n",
            "salty, liquid-water ocean --\n",
            "and we wonder if life might be able to exist there.\n",
            "So given our current exploration strategies --\n",
            "there is a mission in development right now to study Europa,\n",
            "it’ll actually orbit Jupiter\n",
            "and it’ll do flybys of Europa\n",
            "and remotely measure the Moon and its ocean.\n",
            "But how about this?\n",
            "So I envision a future where to study Europa’s ocean,\n",
            "we send submarines down into the ocean itself.\n",
            "And we study the ocean from within the ocean,\n",
            "and we directly search for signs of life.\n",
            "And while we’re at it,\n",
            "we should also send submersibles to Enceladus.\n",
            "Enceladus is a moon of Saturn.\n",
            "It’s amazing.\n",
            "It also has a subsurface --\n",
            "salty, liquid-water ocean --\n",
            "because we see\n",
            "literally geysers of water ice coming out of its south polar region.\n",
            "And it’s not just Europa and Enceladus.\n",
            "The outer solar system is full of ocean worlds.\n",
            "And if we have learned one thing about studying life on Earth --\n",
            "which, by the way, also an ocean world --\n",
            "it’s that all life requires liquid water to survive.\n",
            "So we wonder:\n",
            "Could there be life in these other oceans as well?\n",
            "There’s other possibilities, too.\n",
            "Let’s consider astronomy and astrophysics.\n",
            "This is a beautiful image from the Hubble Space Telescope\n",
            "in the constellation of Orion.\n",
            "It is a nebula:\n",
            "a star-forming region where new stars are being born.\n",
            "And in order to understand these processes in the universe,\n",
            "we need large telescopes in space to send us back this type of data.\n",
            "Now you could fit a telescope three times the diameter of Hubble in a Starship.\n",
            "You could actually fit several of those very large telescopes in a Starship.\n",
            "And that’s important because telescopes --\n",
            "size matters, right?\n",
            "The telescope is like a light-collecting bucket,\n",
            "and you want to collect as many photons as you possibly can\n",
            "to see objects that are faint\n",
            "and to see objects that are far away.\n",
            "Because the telescope --\n",
            "a telescope is a time machine.\n",
            "The further away an object is,\n",
            "the older it is,\n",
            "because it takes a finite amount of time\n",
            "for that light to travel from that object to your eyeball, right?\n",
            "That's why it's called the speed of light.\n",
            "So with these larger telescopes,\n",
            "we can address these science questions,\n",
            "like searching for exoplanets,\n",
            "planets around other stars\n",
            "and understanding the formation of stars\n",
            "and planetary systems ...\n",
            "and looking back to the cosmic dawn --\n",
            "the literal beginning of time --\n",
            "and fundamentally understanding our own place in the universe.\n",
            "But it's not just the size of the telescopes.\n",
            "We can also reduce the cost.\n",
            "So the James Webb Space Telescope --\n",
            "JWST --\n",
            "fantastic instrument,\n",
            "amazing.\n",
            "The telescope is relatively large,\n",
            "so it didn't fit on any existing launch vehicles.\n",
            "So it had to be folded up,\n",
            "like a piece of origami,\n",
            "to fit on the rocket.\n",
            "So if we have larger vehicles that can launch larger telescopes,\n",
            "we can just launch them already fully assembled, right?\n",
            "No deployment in space necessary.\n",
            "So the science that can be enabled is amazing,\n",
            "but it's about more than the science.\n",
            "It’s also about the exploration.\n",
            "Because for the first time in the history of our entire planet --\n",
            "and that’s about a little over four and a half billion years\n",
            "for anybody that’s keeping track --\n",
            "we are on the cusp of having both the scientific and technical capability\n",
            "to send humans to build a future off of our home planet.\n",
            "And here's how we're going to do it on Mars.\n",
            "So first we need to send uncrewed starships to Mars.\n",
            "I mean, we have to prove that we can safely land those vehicles\n",
            "before we can send humans on them.\n",
            "But we will use that amazing payload capacity of the Starships\n",
            "to send elements that we need\n",
            "in order to enable a sustained human presence on Mars.\n",
            "And we’re going to start with what we call ISRU:\n",
            "In-Situ Resource Utilization.\n",
            "That basically means living off the land.\n",
            "Because if we want to have a self-sustaining presence on Mars,\n",
            "we cannot be Earth-reliant, right?\n",
            "We cannot ferry everything we need from Earth to Mars all the time.\n",
            "You know, living off of local resources --\n",
            "it’s been critical to human survival since the beginning of our entire species.\n",
            "Our ancestors for millennia have been learning how to use local resources\n",
            "to do things like, you know, build tools\n",
            "and grow food\n",
            "and generate energy.\n",
            "So, I mean, we’re lucky.\n",
            "We live on a pretty cushy planet right now.\n",
            "That’s why we’re all here today:\n",
            "we have everything that we need.\n",
            "But Mars is different.\n",
            "And Mars is unforgiving.\n",
            "And if you run out of food\n",
            "or fuel\n",
            "or oxygen,\n",
            "you’re done.\n",
            "So we have to be very smart about how we do ISRU on Mars.\n",
            "And the way we’re going to start is by using water ice as a resource.\n",
            "We know Mars has lots of water ice.\n",
            "There’s ground ice,\n",
            "there’s rock-covered glaciers,\n",
            "there’s ice for us to use.\n",
            "Now, traditionally, when people talk about sending humans to Mars,\n",
            "we talk about sending like a few people\n",
            "and maybe a little rover so they can drive around\n",
            "and explore a little bit.\n",
            "But Starship is so transformational\n",
            "that now we can talk about sending the heavy-duty construction machinery\n",
            "to build the infrastructure that we need for a large-scale presence on Mars.\n",
            "So I’m talking like dump trucks and backhoes and large drill rigs --\n",
            "all the things we’re going to need for ISRU and beyond.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "And another thing that we need to do before the humans arrive\n",
            "is serach for Indigenous Martian life.\n",
            "So this is a top-priority science question.\n",
            "Is there life on Mars?\n",
            "But we also have to do due diligence\n",
            "to make sure that that landing site is safe\n",
            "for the humans to come and live and work.\n",
            "So once we get all that robotic precursor work done,\n",
            "then the humans can arrive.\n",
            "And this is when we start building up a base\n",
            "and moving towards a civilization on Mars.\n",
            "Now just imagine that for a moment, right?\n",
            "At this point, there will actually be Martians,\n",
            "except they will be people like you and me.\n",
            "And it’s about more than just Mars,\n",
            "because as we develop this capability to send humans into the solar system,\n",
            "we can truly begin to address questions such as:\n",
            "Are we alone in the universe,\n",
            "and can humans thrive off-planet?\n",
            "So the opportunities that are afforded us by these supersized spacecraft\n",
            "are truly unprecedented,\n",
            "and they’re like nothing that we’ve ever had before.\n",
            "And they’re completely changing the paradigm for space exploration.\n",
            "It has taken the entire history of our planet\n",
            "to reach this point right now.\n",
            "So I think it’s an amazing time to be alive,\n",
            "because what we do next will forever change the course of human history.\n",
            "So now is the time to seize the opportunity\n",
            "and expand humanity throughout the cosmos.\n",
            "Thank you.\n",

Yet historian Yuval Noah Harari's analysis, based on the work of scientists and economists, indicates that humanity might avert catastrophe by investing the equivalent of just two percent of global GDP into climate solutions. He makes the case that preventing ecological cataclysm will not require the major global disruptions many fear and explains that we already have the resources we need -- it's just a matter of shifting our priorities.\n\nCountdown is TED's global initiative to accelerate solutions to the climate crisis. The goal: to build a better future by cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, in the race to a zero-carbon world. Get involved at ",

Nobel Laureate John C.

            "So we built it.\n",
            "And then we've launched it.\n",
            "It went up into space from French Guiana on Christmas morning, 2021.\n",
            "It was a perfect launch.\n",
            "The Arianespace company sent it straight to where we needed to go.\n",
            "So we think we can have 20 years of operational scientific observations\n",
            "with this great new telescope.\n",
            "And it took only two minutes to go through the tropical clouds up\n",
            "towards the vacuum of outer space.\n",
            "Now I want to show you how it unfolded in outer space,\n",
            "this origami telescope.\n",
            "First we unfolded the solar panels.\n",
            "Then we unfold the transmitter antenna\n",
            "so we can talk back and forth.\n",
            "Then we unfold the panels that hold the great sunshade in place.\n",
            "This takes us actually two weeks in real life.\n",
            "You see it compressed here so we can show it to you.\n",
            "This is just a miracle of modern engineering, and it’s so complicated.\n",
            "And you'd say, is there any way you could have done this\n",
            "without this great telescope?\n",
            "And the answer seems to be no.\n",
            "You need a big telescope.\n",
            "It needs to be in outer space.\n",
            "It needs to be cold, so it doesn’t glow and emit its own infrared.\n",
            "And third is, being very carefully unrolled all by commands from here.\n",
            "So you ask, how could you possibly make such a complicated thing work?\n",
            "Well, number one, practice, practice, practice,\n",
            "rehearse and test, fix it when it's not quite right.\n",
            "And then, of course, have two of everything, if you possibly can.\n",
            "And third, have arguments with all of your friends to say,\n",
            "is this really right?\n",
            "Can you think of anything that's a mistake that we might be making\n",
            "that we should fix before we launch it?\n",
            "So the last step is finally to unfold the telescope itself.\n",
            "And there it is in outer space,\n",
            "not quite ready to use because it's still warm and has not yet been focused.\n",
            "So we had to wait for several weeks for it to start to cool down\n",
            "to a low enough temperature that we could do the next steps.\n",
            "We send it to a place called Lagrange Point 2,\n",
            "about a million miles farther out from the Sun than we are.\n",
            "This is a place that moves around the Sun with us every year,\n",
            "so the telescope does not get any farther away.\n",
            "It is the only place that we can put a telescope where this is the setup,\n",
            "and you can have the one-sided umbrella that protects the telescope\n",
            "from the Sun and the Earth and the Moon.\n",
            "So the next thing is, what did we see?\n",
            "We focused the telescope and took some pictures\n",
            "of the same star we looked at with the Webb.\n",
            "So the fuzzy picture is the Spitzer Space Telescope launched in 2003.\n",
            "The sharp picture is the new Webb telescope.\n",
            "We were so thrilled that it worked.\n",
            "We got a nice, sharp image of the star,\n",
            "and we can calculate now the sensitivity of this object,\n",
            "that if you were a bumblebee,\n",
            "a square centimeter object hovering at the distance\n",
            "of the Moon from the Earth, away from the telescope,\n",
            "we would be able to see you,\n",
            "both the sunlight you reflect and the heat you emit.\n",
            "So there are no bumblebees in space,\n",
            "but there's something out there that we don't know.\n",
            "And I'm so sure that we're going to get a great surprise from this telescope.\n",
            "So I'll show you what we look at.\n",
            "Here is an example of a place where stars are being born as we speak.\n",
            "Now we know, more or less, that stars explode and produce dust,\n",
            "which goes and is recycled into new stars.\n",
            "This is a place where the recycling is happening.\n",
            "Stars are being born in this beautiful cloud of glowing gas and dust.\n",
            "On the left-hand side shows you what we see with visible light\n",
            "with the Hubble Space Telescope.\n",
            "The right-hand side shows you that you can begin to see through the dust\n",
            "with an infrared camera that we also have on the Hubble telescope.\n",
            "It's beautiful.\n",
            "Astronomers want to see inside and we will\n",
            "with the Webb telescope.\n",
            "We can look at everything in the solar system from Mars on out.\n",
            "So this is a pretty interesting one,\n",
            "everybody knows Mars might be alive.\n",
            "What about Europa?\n",
            "Europa is a satellite of Jupiter.\n",
            "It has a liquid ocean covered with ice.\n",
            "We know because we sent a probe out there named after Galileo himself,\n",
            "and we saw this and took this picture.\n",
            "Now we know that there is water coming out from the cracks\n",
            "between the ice blocks\n",
            "and once in a while, they can be watched from here.\n",
            "And we are planning to send a probe to fly through the water jets\n",
            "and see if there might be any organic molecules in them.\n",
            "Is it alive? Well, maybe.\n",
            "We'll be watching this satellite with the Webb telescope as well.\n",
            "Farther on out in the solar system, we've been watching Titan.\n",
            "Titan is the only moon in the solar system that has oceans and lakes\n",
            "and rain and rivers and an atmosphere on the surface.\n",
            "It is so cold, though,\n",
            "that its liquid hydrocarbons, methane and ethane,\n",
            "that you would use for fuel here on Earth.\n",
            "So we'll be examining this with the Webb telescope\n",
            "and we'll be sending a probe out there\n",
            "to land with even a helicopter to go exploring.\n",
            "So is this a place that's interesting for life?\n",
            "Possibly.\n",
            "People ask me all the time,\n",
            "are we sure that the kind we have here is the only kind?\n",
            "Well, maybe not.\n",
            "And if not, this is a good place to look because it's different,\n",
            "but it still has solids, liquids and gases,\n",
            "and it has a liquid hydrocarbon, which might be a possible solvent.\n",
            "We'll see.\n",
            "Next thing we want to look at is,\n",
            "are there planets around other stars that might have life?\n",
            "So we will be looking in this way\n",
            "at small stars that have Earth-sized planets.\n",
            "When a planet goes in front of the star, it can block some starlight,\n",
            "some of the starlight goes through the atmosphere of the planet,\n",
            "if it has one,\n",
            "and on its way to our telescope,\n",
            "and we can analyze that\n",
            "and look for the chemistry of such an atmosphere.\n",
            "So, number one, does a little Earth-like planet out there\n",
            "have an atmosphere?\n",
            "Number two, does it have any molecules in the atmosphere?\n",
            "And number three, could they be water?\n",
            "Is there enough water out there so that there could be a liquid ocean?\n",
            "Well, maybe.\n",
            "We will find out and we'll tell you.\n",
            "So are we alone?\n",
            "Well, I don't know.\n",
            "But we'll be going on after this project\n",
            "to even more powerful telescopes\n",
            "that can examine little Earths around stars like the Sun.\n",
            "And then we'll be able to say, \"Really, really, are they like home?\"\n",
            "And maybe yes.\n",
            "We will be telling you all about what we find out,\n",
            "beginning with our first scientific observations this summer.\n",
            "So please stay tuned.\n",

            "They orchestrated diagnostic capacity.\n",
            "They came up with distancing policies and quarantine policies.\n",
            "And so their overall death rate per capita will be well less\n",
            "than a 10th of other countries.\n",

            "And that's what we have to do next time.\n",
            "When COVID struck, we were almost like Rome\n",

            "So it can be used anywhere.\n",
            "We need other R&D investments.\n",
            "One that I'm very excited about is the idea of a drug\n",
            "that you inhale that blocks you from getting infected.\n",

            "so that you'll be protected.\n",
            "A lot of the tools, the diagnostic tools\n",
            "and those infection-blocking tools are important\n",
            "because they can be staged in advance.\n",
            "Now, we also need vaccines,\n",
            "but we want to stop the outbreak\n",
            "before we have to do a global vaccination campaign.\n",
            "And so vaccines can play a couple of different roles,\n",
            "but not the primary role.\n",
            "We have to invest in more than just that.\n",
            "When we look at vaccines, they were the miracle of this epidemic.\n",

            "In this case, there were lots of breakthrough infections.\n",
            "We need vaccines that are broad spectrum,\n",
            "so they work against most of the emerging variants,\n",
            "which we did not have this time.\n",
            "And we also need factories that are standing by\n",

            "and if we get rid of it, it can never cause a pandemic.\n",
            "So I'm talking about investments in three broad areas:\n",
            "Disease monitoring,\n",
            "that's GERM.\n",
            "The R and D tools that are far better.\n",

            "And even it'll save money in the long run.\n",
            "It's like an insurance policy.\n",
            "The cost to prevent the next pandemic will be tens of billions of dollars.\n",
            "But let's compare that to what we just went through.\n",
            "The IMF estimates that COVID has cost nearly 14 trillion dollars.\n",
            "And so we need to spend billions in order to save trillions.\n",
            "And here's the best part of this.\n",
            "Even when we're not having an outbreak, these investments like the Lumira,\n",
            "those new vaccines,\n",
            "they will make people healthier.\n",
            "They'll shrink the gap, the health equity gap,\n",

            "For example, we can detect more HIV cases and do a better job of treatment.\n",
            "We can reduce deaths from malaria.\n",

            "If we take the right steps,\n",
            "we can make COVID-19 the last pandemic,\n",

            "and she asked me what I was going to New York to do.\n",

            "And I know because I had helped to articulate it over 15 years before.\n",
            "In 2003, purpose was just one element\n",
            "of a much larger strategic transformation that Delta Airlines undertook.\n",
            "It was a company still reeling from the aftereffects of 9/11\n",
            "and one looking for a North Star to guide them through\n",
            "would eventually become Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n",

            "Both mission and vision are important corporate drivers,\n",

            "They are important, but they are also temporal.\n",
            "In my experience,\n",
            "they often have a time horizon of, say, three to five years.\n",

            "distinctive to your brand,\n",
            "meaningful to all of your stakeholders\n",

            "I once worked with a CEO\n",

            "it would have been dead on arrival.\n",
            "Specifically with employees.\n",
            "Secondly, I tell CEOs that they must be critical\n",
            "in excavating purpose from the inside out.\n",
            "Purpose is uncomfortable.\n",
            "It should be,\n",
            "because you are introducing a tension between idealism and realism:\n",

            "today and in the future,\n",
            "based on competencies and ethos.\n",
            "And purpose can be particularly discomforting\n",

            "it takes a while to implement it.\n",

            "companies in industries like oil and gas, for example,\n",
            "or for companies who maybe have bad behaviors they need to leave behind.\n",
            "Finally, I tell CEOs that purpose must apply\n",
            "to the whole of the organization.\n",
            "Purpose is not a CEO vanity project.\n",
            "Sure, it may help cement the legacy of the CEO\n",

            "It is about the role in the world that it’s meant to play.\n",
            "Now purpose at the C-suite level should be a unifying construct\n",
            "that brings together mission and vision\n",
            "and influences your strategic agenda.\n",
            "It should help CEOs think about how they redefine metrics for success,\n",

            "The middle-management layer of any organization\n",
            "is often the most difficult to motivate\n",

            "But by bringing clarity\n",
            "with purpose-driven expectations and guardrails,\n",
            "it allows middle managers to understand which battles to pick\n",

            "When purpose is excavated and executed top floor to shop floor,\n",
            "those on the shop floor understand that their work matters\n",
            "and how it adds up to the overall value for the company.\n",

            "I was also pretty ambitious and on the verge of making partner.\n",
            "Or so I thought.\n",
            "Because, one day, a senior partner named Steve Shalen\n",
            "knocked on my office door.\n",
            "Steve was tall and distinguished and very decent.\n",
            "And he sat down and he reached for the squishy stress ball on my desk,\n",
            "and he said that I wasn't going to be making partner after all.\n",
            "And I remember very badly wishing that I had a stress ball too,\n",

            "And so, now I was in my early 30s,\n",
            "and suddenly I had no career,\n",

            "that I had longed for since I was four years old.\n",
            "He was an emissary from the beautiful world.\n",

            "And then even lullabies,\n",

            "that we come from a perfect and beautiful one\n",
            "that remains forever out of reach.\n",

            "And of course it's true,\n",

        "video_description": "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has created previously unthinkable changes in geopolitics, seemingly overnight. In this vital conversation, political analyst Ian Bremmer takes a closer look at the global implications of the war, including NATO and the EU’s renewed sense of purpose, the spiral of escalation, energy politics and the significant, potentially permanent shifts in the world order.\n\nThis interview, hosted by TED global curator Bruno Giussani,, was recorded on March 10, 2022 as part of a TED Membership event and the series \"TED Explains the World with Ian Bremmer.\" Watch more: ",

            "Bruno Giussani: It's difficult to think clearly of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, because wars, while they unfold,\n",
            "they're kind of shrouded in a sort of fog. Information is abundant: the millions of refugees,\n",
            "the shocking suffering and the destruction, the politics. But sense is lacking.\n",
            "And that's going to be the focus of this Membership conversation as we enter the third week of the war.\n",
            "We won’t talk about the events of the day but try to project a longer arc, a broader context.\n",
            "Our guest is geopolitical analyst Ian Bremmer. He's the founder and president of Eurasia Group,\n",
            "and we asked him to lay the scene by talking first about the geopolitical shifts that have already been brought by the war in Ukraine.\n",
            "And after, we're going to have a conversation, including questions from TED Members who are participating in this call.\n",
            "Ian, welcome. Ian Bremmer: Thank you very much. I'll start by saying that in my lifetime,\n",
            "the most important geopolitical artifact is the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n",
            "I mean, you see it if you go into the new NATO headquarters in Brussels, just built a few years ago.\n",
            "And anyone that has a piece, something they're very proud of, they know it affected their entire lives.\n",
            "I think that in 30 years' time, and I fear that in 30 years' time, if we look back,\n",
            "a second most important geopolitical artifact will be a piece of the rubble of the Maidan in Kyiv.\n",
            "I believe that the war that we are seeing right now is no more and no less\n",
            "than the end of the peace dividend that we all thought we had\n",
            "when the wall came down in 1989. The idea that the world could focus more on globalization\n",
            "and goods and services and people and ideas going faster and faster across borders,\n",
            "leading to unprecedented growth in human development and a global middle class.\n",
            "I think that this is a tipping point. Won't end globalization, but it does end the peace dividend.\n",
            "It does mean that the Europeans overnight will and must prioritize spending on defense policy,\n",
            "on national security, coordination, on NATO. And the speech that was given by Olaf Scholz,\n",
            "the new chancellor, two weeks ago, in my view, the most significant speech given by a European leader\n",
            "in the post-Cold War environment, precisely because it's now the post-post-Cold War environment,\n",
            "sending weapons to the Ukrainians, committing to over two percent of GDP spend on defense,\n",
            "investing in a new fund for defense infrastructure. But also recognizing that the way\n",
            "that the Germans and the Europeans as a whole looked at the world and looked at themselves was,\n",
            "unfortunately for all of us, outdated. A few other points I'd like to raise, just to kick off this conversation.\n",
            "One: One of the reasons I'm pretty negative about this, and I'm not usually very negative, I'm usually an existential optimist,\n",
            "I’m someone that’s just happy there’s water in the glass. But when I look at this conflict, I’m much more concerned.\n",
            "And that is because I do not see a scenario, a plausible scenario, in the foreseeable future\n",
            "where Putin emerges from this war in anything less than a radically weakened position\n",
            "compared to where he was before he announced the invasion. And I believe that both in terms of his domestic political orientation,\n",
            "how stable he is in his own country, also, of course, Russia's economic position,\n",
            "and finally, Russia's position in terms of global security and European security: ostensibly, the very reason that Putin began the war to begin with.\n",
            "Second big point is that the decoupling that we are seeing from Europe\n",
            "and the United States with Russia is, in my view, permanent. And that would be true even if there were a negotiated settlement\n",
            "and all the Russian troops were to pull out of Ukraine and we had peace. I still think that a lot of those companies would not come back\n",
            "with Putin in power. I'm convinced that the decisions by the Europeans\n",
            "to ramp up their national security capabilities will be permanent. Permanent deployments coming in the Baltic states, for example,\n",
            "forward deployments in Poland and Bulgaria and Romania. And also an unwind of Europe’s massive energy dependence:\n",
            "coal, oil and most importantly, gas on Russia. That does not make Russia a global pariah\n",
            "because you can't be a global pariah if the soon-to-be most important economy in the world, China,\n",
            "is actually your bestie on the global stage, and that indeed continues to be true despite China's efforts to portray themselves,\n",
            "towards Europe at least, as more neutral. We are going to see the Russians as a supplicant economically,\n",
            "in terms of energy flows, financially, in terms of transactions, and technologically, perhaps most important,\n",
            "aligned with China. That has big geopolitical implications long-term. Also, a lot of other developing economies, like the Indians,\n",
            "like the Gulf states, like Brazil, are also not going to work with Russia as a pariah.\n",
            "They'll continue to engage. Are there any silver linings? And I think there are a few.\n",
            "Of course, there is a much greater renewed purpose and mission of NATO.\n",
            "I mean, this is an organization that just a couple of years ago, France President Emmanuel Macron referred to as “brain-dead.”\n",
            "It was increasingly drifting in terms of its importance. The Americans were focusing much more on Asia, the pivot.\n",
            "Not today. Today, NATO is purposeful, it's aligned, it's consolidated.\n",
            "it's going to get more resources, not less. That's also true of the European Union as a whole,\n",
            "even when we talk about countries like Hungary and Poland that have been much less aligned in terms of rule of law,\n",
            "in terms of an independent judiciary, much more aligned in terms of the importance of common values of Europe\n",
            "compared to that of what we're seeing in Moscow. I mentioned the German security and policy shift.\n",
            "The UK-EU relationship is much smoother and more functional than at any point since Brexit process actually started.\n",
            "And even the United States. I mean, if you watched the State of the Union for a brief moment in time, five or 10 minutes,\n",
            "when all of the Democrats and Republicans were standing and applauding together, you could be forgiven for believing that the United States\n",
            "had a functional representative democracy. Now I'm not sure how long this is going to last,\n",
            "but at least as of now, leaders of the Democratic and Republican Party see Putin as much more of a threat, an enemy,\n",
            "than they do their opponents across the aisle in domestic politics. And two weeks ago, that was not true.\n",
            "That's significant. Final silver lining, and I wish it was more of one, but the Chinese,\n",
            "as much as they are strategically aligned with Russia and with the person of President Putin,\n",
            "they do not want a second Cold War. And they would rather a negotiated settlement.\n",
            "They're not willing to push very hard for it. But they certainly do not see a radical decoupling of the Russian,\n",
            "and potentially the Chinese economy, from the rest of the world, from Europe,\n",
            "from the US, from the advanced industrial democracies, as in any way in their interest. And ultimately, that does create at least some buffer,\n",
            "some guardrail on how much this is likely to escalate as a conflict going forward.\n",
            "BG: I want to make a step back and unpack some of that, maybe starting with a question that relates to your last point\n",
            "and is probably on the mind of many. And it is: Is there still some real space for negotiation?\n",
            "Is there still a potential relationship between Russia and Ukraine? IB: The foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine just met recently in Turkey.\n",
            "It was as much of a non-event as the three preceding negotiations of more junior representatives\n",
            "of their teams on the Belarus border. The one thing that has been accomplished to a small degree\n",
            "has been humanitarian corridors, extending out of a number of Ukrainian cities\n",
            "that are being pounded by Russian military. That's because the Ukrainians are interested in protecting their civilians,\n",
            "and the Russians are interested in taking a lot of territory without necessarily having to kill so many Ukrainians,\n",
            "that could cause problems for them internationally as well as domestically inside Russia. But that is nowhere close to a negotiated settlement.\n",
            "Now, I mean, everyone I know that's involved in the negotiations right now responds that the President Putin himself is hell-bent on taking Kyiv\n",
            "and on removing Zelenskyy from power. Now I think, and by the way, they're getting quite close\n",
            "to being able to accomplish that militarily on the ground. I think within the next couple of weeks, certainly, it looks very likely.\n",
            "A couple of points here. One, there is no reason to put any stock in anything that the Russians are saying publicly in terms of their diplomacy.\n",
            "They lied to the face of every world leader about the invasion that they said they were not going to do into Ukraine.\n",
            "And then just today, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov publicly said, well, the Russians didn't attack Ukraine.\n",
            "I mean, this is Orwellian stuff, right? So first of all, do not report on Russian public statements\n",
            "as if they bear any semblance to reality on the ground. Secondarily, this looks like a huge loss for Putin right now.\n",
            "He understands it, and I think he would have a hard time, even with his control of information, spinning this to his public\n",
            "without removing Zelenskyy, without the “de-Nazification,” as he calls it -- which is an obscenity in an environment\n",
            "where the Ukrainian president is actually Jewish -- the disarmament of Ukraine,\n",
            "and of course, the ability of the Russians to change how they feel about Ukraine as a threat to the Russian homeland.\n",
            "BG: What level of support can we give Ukraine militarily, intel, economic, before Putin considers taking a strike on a NATO country?\n",
            "IB: Well, it’s interesting the way you framed that, Bruno. Because I mean, I think that Putin is already considering strikes on NATO countries.\n",
            "I mean, there were massive attacks, cyberattacks and disinformation attacks,\n",
            "by Russia against NATO countries with reckless abandon over the course of the past years.\n",
            "And in fact, when President Biden met with Putin in Geneva back in June, it seems like years and years ago at this point,\n",
            "Biden set the agenda. Ukraine was largely not discussed, but what was discussed was cyberattacks on critical infrastructure.\n",
            "Because you may remember Bruno, that meeting came right after the cyber attacks\n",
            "against the Colonial Pipeline. And the Russians after that indeed pulled back\n",
            "on supporting those attacks by their criminal cyber syndicates. I expect those attacks to restart in very short order\n",
            "against NATO countries. I also believe that the fact that the West is sending weapons to Ukraine\n",
            "and is providing real-time intelligence reports on the disposition of Russian troops on the ground in Ukraine\n",
            "to better allow the Ukrainians to defend themselves and blow the Russians up, that is considered by the Russians to be an act of war,\n",
            "and they will retaliate. And how they retaliate is the question. I don't think they're going to send troops into Poland.\n",
            "But you know, when the Americans under Reagan were providing that kind of support\n",
            "to the mujahideen to help them defeat the Soviets in Afghanistan,\n",
            "the Soviets saw that as an act of war, and they engaged in acts of terrorism against the mujahideen in Pakistan.\n",
            "And I absolutely think that that is on the table in terms of front line NATO countries especially,\n",
            "like Poland, like the Baltic states, like Bulgaria, Romania. Would that be considered an Article V attack?\n",
            "Would that force NATO countries to strike the Russians back? I'm not sure it would.\n",
            "Not directly, not militarily. So I mean, I do think that the fact that the NATO countries see\n",
            "there is some sort of a big red line between sending troops in, for example,\n",
            "and doing a no-fly zone because that could cause World War III,\n",
            "but everything short of that is just a proxy war. The Russians don't see it that way.\n",
            "And that gives the Russians some advantage tactically in terms of their willingness to escalate.\n",
            "BG: You're describing a spiral of escalation here that will touch the globe and not only Ukraine,\n",
            "not only the eastern flank of Europe, which means that not only this war has ripple effects everywhere,\n",
            "but this is also starting a sort of realignment of the global geopolitical situation and context.\n",
            "To me, it has been very striking how Europe and the US have kind of moved very fast in a cohesive way.\n",
            "And it has chosen, after years of prioritizing the economics in their international and global dealings,\n",
            "it's chosen to put politics over markets. It has adopted sanctions that will hurt Russia, but will also hurt Western businesses.\n",
            "It’s the discussion about decoupling that you put forward before, an active kind of fencing out of the Russian economy.\n",
            "Talk to us about how do you see this decoupling playing out. IB: Yeah, I mean, I do think that for the Europeans,\n",
            "this is a permanent move. I mean, I've spoken to top leaders in the German government who tell me that Nord Stream was a strategic mistake,\n",
            "and they understand it. Who say that, you know, Scholz making this speech from the Social Democratic Party\n",
            "on the center left is the equivalent of Nixon going to China. No one else could have made that move.\n",
            "But having made it, everyone is on board. The popularity in Germany,\n",
            "even given the massive economic consequences, is extraordinary and is across the board.\n",
            "And what they need to do now is ensure that the diversification of fossil fuels in the near term\n",
            "away from Russia, towards Qatar and Azerbaijan and even, you know,\n",
            "sort of the United States for LNG, can be done as fast as humanly possible.\n",
            "And that further, even though it’s going to cost a lot, some of it will be uneconomic, the move towards renewables actually picks up and is faster.\n",
            "The Italians, Mario Draghi, I think his shift in strategic orientation that they will do,\n",
            "this is his \"whatever it takes\" moment. He had that in response to the 2008 financial crisis\n",
            "as the head of the European Central Bank, and that made him “Super Mario.” This is making him Super Mario as the Italian prime minister.\n",
            "This is the \"whatever it takes\" moment for the Italians who never make public statements that undermine their economic,\n",
            "their commercial interests like this in such a strategic way. The French, of course, have less to be concerned about\n",
            "in the sense that most of their energy comes from nuclear power and is domestic. So they are not as affected directly by a cut-off from Russia.\n",
            "And also because Macron fancies himself, especially as the leader of the European Commission this year,\n",
            "the rotating leadership, occupying the presidency, but also with his elections coming up, and just given his personal belief that he can drive diplomacy,\n",
            "I believe that even after Kyiv falls and after Zelenskyy is either killed or forced out\n",
            "that the Americans will not want to engage in direct diplomacy, the Germans probably won't.\n",
            "The French will. And by the way, the Chinese will too. And I do believe that there is a potential,\n",
            "and this is a danger for the cohesiveness of the West, that the Chinese and Macron end up being the post-Kyiv Normandy format\n",
            "of diplomacy. That's something that the Americans and the Germans right now are starting to worry about quite a bit.\n",
            "Now that's the European shift. And I think, as I said, I think it's permanent. I believe the UK is in that camp as well.\n",
            "I'm not so sure the United States is going to be as committed for as long a term.\n",
            "It doesn't affect the Americans as much economically, it doesn't affect the Americans as much in terms of a direct security issue.\n",
            "None of those refugees are coming to the United States. But also American inequality,\n",
            "American political polarization and dysfunction is so much greater than what you experience on the continent in Europe.\n",
            "So the potential that in six months' time or in two years' time, as we're thinking about the 2024 election,\n",
            "that the Americans have largely forgotten about this Russia issue instead, are focusing once again on domestic political opponents\n",
            "as principal adversaries, which deeply undermines NATO, much more than anything that would come from the Europeans,\n",
            "I think that is a real open question going forward that is perhaps as significant as the question of where the Chinese go.\n",
            "BG: Let me pick up on the point you made about energy, because somehow Putin's calculus can really change\n",
            "if Russian oil and gas stops flowing to Europe, if it becomes part of the sanctions, right?\n",
            "And this war indeed can kind of be read as a war about energy. Selling energy funds it for Russia,\n",
            "being dependent on Russian energy makes the European response more constrained.\n",
            "Rising energy insecurity, rising energy cost may or probably will destabilize European politics and economy\n",
            "in the coming months. How would you look at this from the perspective of energy,\n",
            "and is there any likelihood that Russian oil and gas is going to stop flowing,\n",
            "either because Putin cuts it or the Europeans sanction it? IB: Yeah, or because it's blown up in some of the transit in Ukraine?\n",
            "I mean, keep in mind, so much of the gas transit is going through large pipeline networks, which have some redundancy across all of Ukraine.\n",
            "But there's a big war that's going on right there, and lots of people that could have incentive to create problems.\n",
            "The Americans, of course, the Canadians, have said that they're cutting off oil import from Russia,\n",
            "but those are nominal numbers, so they don't matter very much to the markets. The Europeans, as I said,\n",
            "want to decouple themselves as quickly as possible, but they believe that doing that this year would be economic suicide.\n",
            "So there isn't, despite everything we see from Russia, they're using thermobaric weapons now against the Ukrainian people,\n",
            "the Americans are warning that they could use chemical, biological weapons against Ukraine. I mean, you know, you even have some people saying,\n",
            "what if they use a tactical nuclear weapon? I mean ... God willing, none of these things come to pass.\n",
            "But it is very hard to see a military scenario in Ukraine\n",
            "that leads the Europeans to completely cut off their inbound gas from Russia this year.\n",
            "It's very hard to see. And also, I would say, it's very hard to see any level of economic sanction\n",
            "that would change the mind of the Russians in terms of their military decision making\n",
            "on the ground in Ukraine. Now, I think there are a lot of things that the West is doing in terms of providing weapons for the Ukrainians\n",
            "that are having an impact on the ground. A lot more Russians are getting killed. It won’t prevent them from taking to Kyiv, again in my mind\n",
            "I feel quite confident about that. But it's quite possible, perhaps even likely,\n",
            "that the west of Ukraine will remain in Ukrainian hands, which means that, you know, after this fighting is \"over,\"\n",
            "that a rump Ukrainian state in exile exists in the West, run by Zelenskyy or someone that's aligned with him,\n",
            "and that they continue to get enormous economic and military support from all of the NATO countries.\n",
            "So even though I don't think that the energy situation will become so parlous\n",
            "that it would affect Putin's decision making, I do think that the West's response does matter on the ground.\n",
            "BG: The war is kind of having radiating economic shock waves around the world now,\n",
            "ripple effects on food markets, for example and food security. We talk a lot about energy security,\n",
            "what about food security? IB: Well, you have the largest grain producer in the world\n",
            "invading the fifth largest grain producer in the world on the back of a two-year pandemic that's still ongoing.\n",
            "We don't talk about it much anymore, but it's still there. And of course, this hit the poorest countries in the world the hardest.\n",
            "The level of indebtedness and the unsustainability of paying that debt off was already becoming a massive problem\n",
            "for so many of the developing countries in the world. And the IMF provided a lot of relief in special drawing rights and direct aid\n",
            "over the course of the past 12 months, but that money is now running to an end. And what happens when commodity prices spike up\n",
            "and we have severe supply chain challenges with energy and food, and those things are obviously very related.\n",
            "What happens is that a lot of people die. What happens is we see a lot more starvation.\n",
            "The World Food Organization says about 10 million people a year die of starvation. That number in the next 12 months is going to be a lot higher\n",
            "than it otherwise would have been. The number of people who are food stressed in the world is going to go way up in sub-Saharan Africa, in Yemen,\n",
            "in Afghanistan, in Bangladesh. It's going to go way up. And you know, it's horrible to think about,\n",
            "but the massive impact of this Russia crisis is going to be much more global inequality.\n",

            "Now, if a rump Ukrainian government that is democratically elected\n",
            "were prepared to sue for peace and retakes most of Ukraine, but they give away Crimea and they give away the Donbass,\n",
            "could you see in that environment some of these sanctions unwound? Sure.\n",
            "But I mean, I am suggesting that I think that many of these sanctions are functionally permanent.\n",

            "my response is, what do you mean over? What's over is the peace dividend. We are now in a new environment.\n",
            "BG: And one of the figures of this new environment and I want to close with that, is President Zelenskyy of Ukraine,\n",

            "But I'm very conflicted because I think many of the steps that Zelenskyy took in the run-up to this conflict\n",
            "actually made the likelihood of conflict worse. He was unwilling to take the advice of the Americans and Europeans seriously\n",
            "in the months leading up to the conflict. He was unwilling to mobilize his people to ready them for the potential of conflict.\n",
            "He was certainly unwilling to give an inch in terms of Ukraine's desire to be a member of NATO,\n",
            "even though he knew completely that no one in NATO was prepared to offer a membership action plan,\n",
            "let alone actually bring them in as members. And part of that is a lack of experience\n",
            "and lack of any business being in that position in the run-up to this crisis.\n",
            "So I’m very deeply conflicted in my personal views on Zelenskyy, given the way he behaved before the invasion,\n",
            "compared to the extraordinary leadership that he has displayed to all of us over the last two weeks.\n",

            "don't weaponize gratitude.\n",
            "Now, don't get me wrong, gratitude is a great word.\n",
            "It's nice, it's fluffy, a solid 11 points in Scrabble.\n",
            "However, let's be clear.\n",
            "Although gratitude feels warm and fuzzy,\n",
            "it's not a form of currency.\n",
            "Women are assigned 10 percent more work\n",
            "and spend more time on unrewarded,\n",
            "unrecognized and non-promotable tasks.\n",
            "Basically, what this means is\n",
            "all the things men don't want to do are being handed to women,\n",
            "and a lot of those things largely include things that advance inclusivity,\n",
            "equity and diversity in the workplace.\n",
            "So hear me when I say,\n",
            "a woman shouldn't be grateful to sit at a table.\n",
            "She should be paid to sit at a table.\n",
            "(Applause)\n",
            "Especially ones she largely helped build.\n",
            "And a woman's seat shouldn't be threatened if she doesn't seem \"grateful\" enough.\n",

            "this step involves a woman doing a job\n",
            "and being paid in money, opportunity and promotion,\n",
            "not just gratitude.\n",
            "And women -- yeah, go ahead, live it up, live your life.\n",

            "trust me, I've been there and I know it's so tough,\n",
            "but we have to understand and remember that being grateful\n",
            "and being treated fairly are not mutually exclusive.\n",
            "I can be grateful but still know exactly what I deserve.\n",

            "Heck, it took my grandfather 25 years to see that I was worthy of more.\n",
            "So a true investment is one that values potential over proof.\n",
            "Because so often that proof doesn't exist for women.\n",
            "Not because we aren't qualified,\n",
            "but because we haven't been given the opportunity.\n",

            "there's only one place setting for a woman.\n",
            "People are so used to more men showing up that they plan for it.\n",
            "There's an extra seat in the corner, there's a steak under the heat lamp.\n",
            "When more men show up, the table gets longer.\n",
            "But when that extra RSVP is a woman,\n",
            "more often than not\n",
            "she's encouraged to compete against the only other woman\n",
            "that was invited to the table.\n",
            "Instead, we need to build multiple seats for multiple women,\n",
            "not just one or two,\n",
            "so that women are not sitting on top of each other's laps,\n",
            "fighting for one meal.\n",
            "We already know that more diverse teams perform better.\n",
            "A recent study shows\n",
            "that corporations that have more gender diversity\n",
            "on their executive teams,\n",
            "were 25 percent more likely to experience above average profitability.\n",
            "And more racially diverse companies had 36 percent more profit.\n",
            "So really, no matter how you look at it,\n",
            "it's time to build longer tables and more seats.\n",
            "And I want to say something,\n",
            "and I want to admit something, I want to be vulnerable for a second.\n",
            "Because I've fallen victim to this so many times,\n",
            "and women, let me know if you've experienced this.\n",
            "We have to get rid of the scarcity mindset and champion each other,\n",
            "you know, because I've learned what's the better win?\n",
            "Me sitting at a table\n",
            "or us sitting at a table?\n",
            "Don't be convinced to fight for one spot.\n",
            "Instead fight for multiple spots.\n",
            "(Applause)\n",
            "And let me lead by example right now and say,\n",
            "I know there’s many other women that are going to come on this stage,\n",
            "and I hope they all nail it, and I will be cheering you all on\n",

            "And I'm going to be your biggest cheerleader when you're up here.\n",
            "(Applause)\n",
            "Last, it's time to upgrade the table talk.\n",
            "Now, I believe stories make the world go around.\n",
            "You thought it had something to do the solar system?\n",
            "Joke's on you, it's stories.\n",
            "(Laughs)\n",
            "Stories are how we understand ourselves,\n",
            "how we understand others and how we understand the world.\n",
            "And arguably the most important stories are those we see in the media.\n",
            "Because we’ve seen time and time that they control the narrative\n",
            "and impact culture.\n",
            "Now, when it comes to genre,\n",
            "you can argue that certain genres have certain target demographics.\n",
            "When it comes to the world news, the target demographic is the world,\n",
            "and we know half of the world is female.\n",
            "Yet women and girls make up only a quarter of the people interviewed\n",
            "or that the news is even about in the first place.\n",
            "Instead, when it comes to issues that impact women,\n",
            "we not only need to be included in the coverage,\n",
            "we need to be driving those stories and dimensionalizing our own experience.\n",
            "Inviting everyone in on the table talk isn't just a nice gesture.\n",
            "It makes for better, more productive, smarter conversation\n",
            "with more than one point of view.\n",
            "And that's how you get better.\n",
            "So this all sounds like a lot of work.\n",
            "And it is.\n",
            "But I'm going to tell you why it's necessary and worth it.\n",
            "To be honest, this is about so much more than just women in the workplace.\n",
            "In fact, I could probably come up with many more guidelines\n",
            "across many other industries.\n",
            "This is about creating a world where half of the population can thrive.\n",
            "You see, because the work we do today\n",
            "can create a world where future generations of girls\n",
            "can have equitable access and opportunity.\n",
            "And here's the best part. Are you ready for it?\n",
            "Everyone listening today, all the men, the women,\n",
            "everyone in between, the big companies, the small ones, the media outlets,\n",
            "the people that snuck into the back, all of you,\n",
            "you can help create this future.\n",
            "A future where we have longer tables\n",
            "and more seats that actually work\n",
            "instead of fighting for a seat at the old ones that don't.\n",
            "A future where everyone is seated at the table equally.\n",
            "And a future\n",
            "where being assigned female at birth is not a disappointment\n",
            "or a disadvantage,\n",
            "because girls are encouraged,\n",

            "Bruno Giussani: We are at the end of day six of the war in Ukraine or, more correctly, of the Russian invasion of Ukraine,\n",
            "launched on February 24 by President Vladimir Putin. We are all shocked and saddened by the events\n",
            "and by the human suffering they are causing. And as we speak, really, a Russian military convoy is headed towards Kyiv,\n",
            "other Ukrainian cities are being bombarded, half a million Ukrainians have already fled to neighboring countries\n",
            "and much more. It's still early days, and it's difficult to predict how the situation will evolve\n",
            "even just in the next few hours. But this is a war that should concern everyone, everywhere.\n",
            "And so today, in this TED Membership conversation, we want to try to give it a broader context with our guest,\n",
            "historian and author, Yuval Noah Harari. Yuval, welcome.\n",
            "Yuval Noah Harari: Hello. Thank you for inviting me. BG: I want to start from Ukraine itself and its 42 million people\n",
            "and its particular place between the East and the West. What do we need to know about Ukraine\n",
            "to understand this war and what's at stake? YNH: The most crucial thing to know is that Ukrainians are not Russians,\n",
            "and that Ukraine is an ancient, independent nation. Ukraine has a history of more than a thousand years.\n",
            "Kyiv was a major metropolis and cultural center when Moscow was not even a village.\n",
            "For most of these thousand years Kyiv was not ruled by Moscow. They were not part of the same political entity.\n",
            "For centuries, Kyiv was looking westwards and was a part of a union with Lithuania and Poland\n",
            "until it was eventually conquered and absorbed by the Russian Empire, by the czarist empire.\n",
            "But even after that, Ukrainians remained a separate people to a large extent,\n",
            "and it's important to know that because this is really what is at stake in this war.\n",
            "The key issue of the war, at least for President Putin, is whether Ukraine is an independent nation,\n",
            "whether it is a nation at all. He has this fantasy that Ukraine isn't a nation,\n",
            "that Ukraine is just a part of Russia, that Ukrainians are Russians. In his fantasy,\n",
            "Ukrainians are Russians that want to be back in the fold of Mother Russia,\n",
            "and that the only ones preventing it is a very small gang at the top, which he portrays as Nazis,\n",
            "even if the president is Jewish; but OK, a Nazi Jew.\n",
            "And his belief was, at least, that he just needs to invade,\n",
            "Zelenskyy will flee, the government will collapse, the army would lay down its arms,\n",
            "and the Ukrainian people would welcome the Russian liberators, throwing flowers on them.\n",
            "And this fantasy has been shattered already. Zelenskyy hasn’t fled,\n",
            "the Ukrainian army is fighting. And the Ukrainian people is not throwing flowers on the Russian tanks,\n",
            "it's throwing Molotov cocktails. BG: So let's unpack that and maybe take the different pieces one way one.\n",
            "So Ukraine has a long history of being dominated and occupied. You mentioned the czar, but also the Soviet Union,\n",
            "Hitler's armies. It also has a long history of mistrust of authority and of resistance,\n",
            "which goes some way to explain the current strong resistance that the Russians are encountering.\n",
            "Anne Applebaum, the journalist, even suggests that this mistrust, this resistance to authority,\n",
            "is the very essence of Ukraine-ness, do you agree? YNH: We did see in the last 30 years Ukrainians twice rising in revolt\n",
            "when there was a danger of an authoritarian regime being established -- once in 2004, once in 2013.\n",
            "And when I was in Kyiv a few years ago, what really struck me was this very strong feeling\n",
            "of the desire for independence and for democracy. And I remember walking around this museum\n",
            "of the Revolution of 2013-2014 and seeing these images, like these two elderly women\n",
            "who were bringing sandwiches to the demonstrators, to the fighters.\n",
            "They couldn’t throw stones and they couldn’t do anything else, so they prepared sandwiches and brought this huge tray full of sandwiches\n",
            "to the demonstrators. And this, yes, this is the kind of spirit that inspires not just the Ukrainians\n",
            "but everybody who is now watching what is happening there. BG: Help me understand the actual nature of the threat here\n",
            "in terms of Russia moving into Ukraine. So in your last book, when you write about Russia,\n",
            "you describe the Russian model as: “not a coherent political ideology,\n",
            "but rather a sort of practice of monopolizing power and wealth by a small group at the top.\"\n",
            "But then, in his actions against Ukraine, Putin in the last few weeks seems to move very much by an ideology,\n",
            "an ideology of empire, of denial of Ukraine's right to exist, as you mention.\n",
            "What has changed in the four years since you wrote that book? YNH: The imperial dream was always there,\n",
            "but you know, empires are often the creation of a very small gang of people at the top.\n",
            "I don’t think the Russian people [are] interested in this war. I don't think that the Russian people want to conquer Ukraine\n",
            "or to slaughter the citizens of Kyiv. It's all coming from the top. So there is no change there.\n",
            "I mean, when you look at the Soviet Union, you can say that there was this mass ideology,\n",
            "which was shared by a large proportion, or some proportion, of the population.\n",
            "You don't see this now. You know, Russia is a very rich country,\n",
            "rich in resources, but most people are very poor. Their standard of living is very, very low\n",
            "because all the wealth and power is kind of sucked by the people at the top,\n",
            "and very little is left for everybody else. So I don't think it's a society\n",
            "where the masses are part of this kind of ideological project.\n",
            "They're being ruled from the top. And you have this classic imperial situation,\n",
            "when the emperor, which controls the largest country in the world, feels that, \"Hey, this is not enough.\n",
            "I need more.\" And sends his army to capture, to extend the empire.\n",
            "BG: I said at the beginning that it's difficult, of course, to make predictions. But yesterday, you published an article in \"The Guardian\"\n",
            "titled: “Why Putin has already lost this war.” Please explain. YNH: Well, one thing should be very clear.\n",
            "I don't mean to say that he's going to suffer an immediate military defeat.\n",
            "He definitely has the military power to conquer Kyiv and perhaps the whole of Ukraine.\n",
            "Unfortunately, we might see this. But his long-term goal,\n",
            "the whole rationale of the war, is to deny the existence of the Ukrainian nation\n",
            "and to absorb it into Russia. And to do that, it's not enough to conquer Ukraine.\n",
            "You also need to hold it. And it's all based on this fantasy, on this gamble,\n",
            "that most of the population in Ukraine would agree to this, would even welcome this.\n",
            "And we already know that it's not true. That the Ukrainians are a very real nation;\n",
            "they are fiercely independent; they don’t want to be part of Russia; they will fight like hell.\n",
            "And in the long-run, again, you can conquer a country, But as the Russians learned in Afghanistan,\n",
            "as the Americans learned also in Afghanistan, also in Iraq, it's much harder to hold a country.\n",
            "And again, the big question mark before the war was always this. Before the war started, many things were already known.\n",
            "Everybody knew that the Russian army is much stronger than the Ukrainian Army. Everybody knew that NATO will not send armed forces into Ukraine,\n",
            "troops into Ukraine. Everybody knew that the West, the Europeans, would be hesitant\n",
            "about imposing too strict a sanction regime for fear of being hurt by it themselves.\n",
            "And this was the basis for Putin's war plan. But there was one big unknown.\n",
            "Nobody could say for sure how the Ukrainian people would react.\n",
            "And there was always the option that maybe Putin's fantasy would come true.\n",
            "Maybe the Russians will march in, Zelenskyy would flee, maybe the Ukrainian army will just capitulate\n",
            "and the population would not do much. This was always an option. And now we know this was just fantasy.\n",
            "Now we know that the Ukrainians are fighting, they will fight. And this derails the whole rationale of Putin’s war.\n",
            "Because you can conquer the country, maybe, but you won't be able to absorb Ukraine back into Russia.\n",
            "The only thing he's accomplishing, he is planting seeds of hatred\n",
            "in the hearts of every Ukrainian. Every Ukrainian being killed,\n",
            "every day this war continues is more seeds of hatred\n",
            "that may last for generations. Ukrainians and Russians didn't hate each other before Putin.\n",
            "They’re siblings. Now he's making them enemies. And if he continues, this will be his legacy.\n",
            "BG: We're going to talk a bit about that again later but, you know, at the same time, Putin needs a victory, right?\n",
            "The cost, the human, economic, political cost of this war, not even a week in, is already astronomical.\n",
            "So to justify it and also to remain, by the way, a viable leader at the head of Russia,\n",
            "Putin needs to win, and even win convincingly. So how do we square these things?\n",
            "YNH: I don't know. I mean, the fact that you need to win doesn't mean that you can win.\n",
            "Lots of political leaders need to win, and sometimes they lose. He could stop the war, declare that he won,\n",
            "and say that recognizing Luhansk and Donetsk by the Russians\n",
            "is what he really wanted all along, and he achieved this. Maybe they cobble this agreement, or I don’t know.\n",
            "This is the job of politicians, I'm not a politician. But I can tell you that I hope, for the sake of everybody --\n",
            "Ukrainians, Russians and the whole of humanity -- that this war stops immediately.\n",
            "Because if it doesn't, it's not only the Ukrainians and the Russians that will suffer terribly.\n",
            "Everybody will suffer terribly if this war continues. BG: Explain why.\n",
            "YNH: Because of the shock waves destabilizing the whole world. Let’s start with the bottom line:\n",
            "budgets. We have been living in an amazing era of peace in the last few decades.\n",
            "And it wasn't some kind of hippie fantasy. You saw it in the bottom line.\n",

            "that in addition to the Soviet Union, you had the entire Soviet bloc around it.\n",

That's because, unlike carbon dioxide, methane's warming power doesn't come from a gradual buildup over time but is almost entirely from recent emissions. Ocko identifies three main sources of methane pollution which, if addressed, could dramatically slow down the rate of global warming within years -- not decades. \"This is the methane moment,\" Ocko says.\n\nCountdown is TED's global initiative to accelerate solutions to the climate crisis.

            "to cut methane today.\n",
            "Most methane from energy isn't from burning fossil fuels,\n",
            "it's from producing fossil fuels.\n",
            "Because natural gas, which is mostly methane,\n",
            "can easily escape into the atmosphere\n",
            "when extracting oil, gas and coal,\n",
            "or when transporting gas through pipelines.\n",

            "of using gas instead of coal.\n",
            "But we have the technologies to cut the majority of these emissions\n",
            "with around half for no net cost\n",
            "because the saved gas can be sold.\n",
            "For example, oil fields in West Texas are wasting enough gas right now\n",
            "to heat more than two million homes.\n",
            "Fixing the methane problem, though,\n",
            "can be as simple as tightening a valve or placing a gasket or tuning an engine.\n",
            "A major reason why these easy fixes haven't been implemented isn't the cost.\n",
            "It's because governments and industry have been data-deprived,\n",
            "lacking information on where and how much is emitted.\n",
            "But our ability to detect these leaks has rapidly advanced in recent years.\n",
            "Everything from handheld instruments to sensors on aircrafts and drones.\n",

            "We can also reduce a lot of emissions\n",
            "from the second category, waste management,\n",
            "where methane is produced as bacteria decompose,\n",
            "garbage in landfills and sludge in wastewater.\n",
            "Some of the largest landfills receive enough trash per day\n",

            "But we can suck up the methane from landfills\n",
            "by using tubes with vacuums\n",
            "and then use it to generate electricity,\n",
            "because methane is an energy-packed fuel.\n",
            "We can also reduce emissions by sending some trash, like food waste,\n",
            "away from landfills and instead to composting centers\n",
            "that are designed to prevent the release of methane.\n",
            "The third category, agriculture,\n",
            "emits the most and remains the hardest to address.\n",
            "But there are exciting new technologies on the horizon.\n",
            "The number one source is livestock.\n",
            "Some farm animals, like the billion-plus cattle worldwide,\n",
            "belch methane that was produced when digesting plants like grass.\n",

            "that can suppress methane production in a cow's gut by at least 30 percent\n",
            "with no negative effects on productivity or quality.\n",
            "Livestock manure can also produce methane when concentrated,\n",
            "but we can cover manure lagoons\n",
            "and then pump manure into digesters that can capture the methane,\n",
            "which can then be used for heat and electricity.\n",
            "Another methane source is rice production.\n",
            "This one crop is a staple for half the world's population,\n",
            "but the plants grow in flooded fields\n",
            "that create ideal conditions for microbes to form methane.\n",
            "We can slash emissions from methane\n",
            "by improving how we manage the required water,\n",
            "which can be as simple as maintaining a shallow level of water\n",
            "in the rice fields.\n",
            "Implementing all of these solutions will take work.\n",
            "But people have already started to act.\n",
            "Many governments, oil and gas CEOs,\n",
            "landfill operators and farmers are advancing measures to reduce methane.\n",
            "But we need more,\n",
            "because there is a lot of warming that we can prevent\n",
            "if we quickly deploy the full set of affordable and available strategies.\n",
            "We need standalone methane targets\n",
            "as part of every company's business model,\n",
            "and every country's nationally determined contribution\n",
            "as the Paris Agreement is strengthened.\n",
            "Because if we succeed in a rapid, full-scale effort to cut methane,\n",
            "we have a chance to actually experience the benefits fast,\n",
            "in our lifetimes.\n",
            "For example,\n",
            "my colleagues and I found that we could slow down the rate of warming\n",
            "by as much as 30 percent before mid-century.\n",
            "This would help communities and ecosystems adapt\n",
            "to a changing climate\n",
            "and hit the brakes on worsening extreme events,\n",
            "like wildfires in the Americas and Australia,\n",
            "and flooding in Europe and Asia.\n",
            "It would also help clean up our air, saving lives and crops,\n",
            "because methane contributes to ozone pollution.\n",
            "And because some of the people\n",
            "most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change\n",
            "are on the front lines of methane emissions.\n",
            "These solutions can also help reduce the inequity of climate change,\n",
            "for example, by job creation.\n",
            "If we fast-forward to later decades,\n",
            "acting now to cut methane can also help protect Arctic sea ice.\n",

            "Hi, I'm Jeff.\n",
            "I lead AI Research and Health at Google.\n",
            "I joined Google more than 20 years ago,\n",
            "when we were all wedged into a tiny office space,\n",
            "above what's now a T-Mobile store in downtown Palo Alto.\n",
            "I've seen a lot of computing transformations in that time,\n",
            "and in the last decade, we've seen AI be able to do tremendous things.\n",
            "But we're still doing it all wrong in many ways.\n",
            "That's what I want to talk to you about today.\n",
            "But first, let's talk about what AI can do.\n",
            "So in the last decade, we've seen tremendous progress\n",
            "in how AI can help computers see, understand language,\n",
            "understand speech better than ever before.\n",
            "Things that we couldn't do before, now we can do.\n",
            "If you think about computer vision alone,\n",
            "just in the last 10 years,\n",
            "computers have effectively developed the ability to see;\n",
            "10 years ago, they couldn't see, now they can see.\n",
            "You can imagine this has had a transformative effect\n",
            "on what we can do with computers.\n",
            "So let's look at a couple of the great applications\n",
            "enabled by these capabilities.\n",
            "We can better predict flooding, keep everyone safe,\n",
            "using machine learning.\n",
            "We can translate over 100 languages so we all can communicate better,\n",
            "and better predict and diagnose disease,\n",
            "where everyone gets the treatment that they need.\n",
            "So let's look at two key components\n",
            "that underlie the progress in AI systems today.\n",
            "The first is neural networks,\n",
            "a breakthrough approach to solving some of these difficult problems\n",
            "that has really shone in the last 15 years.\n",
            "But they're not a new idea.\n",
            "And the second is computational power.\n",
            "It actually takes a lot of computational power\n",
            "to make neural networks able to really sing,\n",
            "and in the last 15 years, we’ve been able to have that,\n",
            "and that's partly what's enabled all this progress.\n",
            "But at the same time, I think we're doing several things wrong,\n",
            "and that's what I want to talk to you about\n",
            "at the end of the talk.\n",
            "First, a bit of a history lesson.\n",
            "So for decades,\n",
            "almost since the very beginning of computing,\n",
            "people have wanted to be able to build computers\n",
            "that could see, understand language, understand speech.\n",
            "The earliest approaches to this, generally,\n",
            "people were trying to hand-code all the algorithms\n",
            "that you need to accomplish those difficult tasks,\n",
            "and it just turned out to not work very well.\n",
            "But in the last 15 years, a single approach\n",
            "unexpectedly advanced all these different problem spaces all at once:\n",
            "neural networks.\n",
            "So neural networks are not a new idea.\n",
            "They're kind of loosely based\n",
            "on some of the properties that are in real neural systems.\n",
            "And many of the ideas behind neural networks\n",
            "have been around since the 1960s and 70s.\n",
            "A neural network is what it sounds like,\n",
            "a series of interconnected artificial neurons\n",
            "that loosely emulate the properties of your real neurons.\n",
            "An individual neuron in one of these systems\n",
            "has a set of inputs,\n",
            "each with an associated weight,\n",
            "and the output of a neuron\n",
            "is a function of those inputs multiplied by those weights.\n",
            "So pretty simple,\n",
            "and lots and lots of these work together to learn complicated things.\n",
            "So how do we actually learn in a neural network?\n",
            "It turns out the learning process\n",
            "consists of repeatedly making tiny little adjustments\n",
            "to the weight values,\n",
            "strengthening the influence of some things,\n",
            "weakening the influence of others.\n",
            "By driving the overall system towards desired behaviors,\n",
            "these systems can be trained to do really complicated things,\n",
            "like translate from one language to another,\n",
            "detect what kind of objects are in a photo,\n",
            "all kinds of complicated things.\n",
            "I first got interested in neural networks\n",
            "when I took a class on them as an undergraduate in 1990.\n",
            "At that time,\n",
            "neural networks showed impressive results on tiny problems,\n",
            "but they really couldn't scale to do real-world important tasks.\n",
            "But I was super excited.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "I felt maybe we just needed more compute power.\n",
            "And the University of Minnesota had a 32-processor machine.\n",
            "I thought, \"With more compute power,\n",
            "boy, we could really make neural networks really sing.\"\n",
            "So I decided to do a senior thesis on parallel training of neural networks,\n",
            "the idea of using processors in a computer or in a computer system\n",
            "to all work toward the same task,\n",
            "that of training neural networks.\n",
            "32 processors, wow,\n",
            "we’ve got to be able to do great things with this.\n",
            "But I was wrong.\n",
            "Turns out we needed about a million times as much computational power\n",
            "as we had in 1990\n",
            "before we could actually get neural networks to do impressive things.\n",
            "But starting around 2005,\n",
            "thanks to the computing progress of Moore's law,\n",
            "we actually started to have that much computing power,\n",
            "and researchers in a few universities around the world started to see success\n",
            "in using neural networks for a wide variety of different kinds of tasks.\n",
            "I and a few others at Google heard about some of these successes,\n",
            "and we decided to start a project to train very large neural networks.\n",
            "One system that we trained,\n",
            "we trained with 10 million randomly selected frames\n",
            "from YouTube videos.\n",
            "The system developed the capability\n",
            "to recognize all kinds of different objects.\n",
            "And it being YouTube, of course,\n",
            "it developed the ability to recognize cats.\n",
            "YouTube is full of cats.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "But what made that so remarkable\n",
            "is that the system was never told what a cat was.\n",
            "So using just patterns in data,\n",
            "the system honed in on the concept of a cat all on its own.\n",
            "All of this occurred at the beginning of a decade-long string of successes,\n",
            "of using neural networks for a huge variety of tasks,\n",
            "at Google and elsewhere.\n",
            "Many of the things you use every day,\n",
            "things like better speech recognition for your phone,\n",
            "improved understanding of queries and documents\n",
            "for better search quality,\n",
            "better understanding of geographic information to improve maps,\n",
            "and so on.\n",
            "Around that time,\n",
            "we also got excited about how we could build hardware that was better tailored\n",
            "to the kinds of computations neural networks wanted to do.\n",
            "Neural network computations have two special properties.\n",
            "The first is they're very tolerant of reduced precision.\n",
            "Couple of significant digits, you don't need six or seven.\n",
            "And the second is that all the algorithms are generally composed\n",
            "of different sequences of matrix and vector operations.\n",
            "So if you can build a computer\n",
            "that is really good at low-precision matrix and vector operations\n",
            "but can't do much else,\n",
            "that's going to be great for neural-network computation,\n",
            "even though you can't use it for a lot of other things.\n",
            "And if you build such things, people will find amazing uses for them.\n",
            "This is the first one we built, TPU v1.\n",
            "\"TPU\" stands for Tensor Processing Unit.\n",
            "These have been used for many years behind every Google search,\n",
            "for translation,\n",
            "in the DeepMind AlphaGo matches,\n",
            "so Lee Sedol and Ke Jie maybe didn't realize,\n",
            "but they were competing against racks of TPU cards.\n",
            "And we've built a bunch of subsequent versions of TPUs\n",
            "that are even better and more exciting.\n",
            "But despite all these successes,\n",
            "I think we're still doing many things wrong,\n",
            "and I'll tell you about three key things we're doing wrong,\n",
            "and how we'll fix them.\n",
            "The first is that most neural networks today\n",
            "are trained to do one thing, and one thing only.\n",
            "You train it for a particular task that you might care deeply about,\n",
            "but it's a pretty heavyweight activity.\n",
            "You need to curate a data set,\n",
            "you need to decide what network architecture you'll use\n",
            "for this problem,\n",
            "you need to initialize the weights with random values,\n",
            "apply lots of computation to make adjustments to the weights.\n",
            "And at the end, if you’re lucky, you end up with a model\n",
            "that is really good at that task you care about.\n",
            "But if you do this over and over,\n",
            "you end up with thousands of separate models,\n",
            "each perhaps very capable,\n",
            "but separate for all the different tasks you care about.\n",
            "But think about how people learn.\n",
            "In the last year, many of us have picked up a bunch of new skills.\n",
            "I've been honing my gardening skills,\n",
            "experimenting with vertical hydroponic gardening.\n",
            "To do that, I didn't need to relearn everything I already knew about plants.\n",
            "I was able to know how to put a plant in a hole,\n",
            "how to pour water, that plants need sun,\n",
            "and leverage that in learning this new skill.\n",
            "Computers can work the same way, but they don’t today.\n",
            "If you train a neural network from scratch,\n",
            "it's effectively like forgetting your entire education\n",
            "every time you try to do something new.\n",
            "That’s crazy, right?\n",
            "So instead, I think we can and should be training\n",
            "multitask models that can do thousands or millions of different tasks.\n",
            "Each part of that model would specialize in different kinds of things.\n",
            "And then, if we have a model that can do a thousand things,\n",
            "and the thousand and first thing comes along,\n",
            "we can leverage the expertise we already have\n",
            "in the related kinds of things\n",
            "so that we can more quickly be able to do this new task,\n",
            "just like you, if you're confronted with some new problem,\n",
            "you quickly identify the 17 things you already know\n",
            "that are going to be helpful in solving that problem.\n",
            "Second problem is that most of our models today\n",
            "deal with only a single modality of data --\n",
            "with images, or text or speech,\n",
            "but not all of these all at once.\n",
            "But think about how you go about the world.\n",
            "You're continuously using all your senses\n",
            "to learn from, react to,\n",
            "figure out what actions you want to take in the world.\n",
            "Makes a lot more sense to do that,\n",
            "and we can build models in the same way.\n",
            "We can build models that take in these different modalities of input data,\n",
            "text, images, speech,\n",
            "but then fuse them together,\n",
            "so that regardless of whether the model sees the word \"leopard,\"\n",
            "sees a video of a leopard or hears someone say the word \"leopard,\"\n",
            "the same response is triggered inside the model:\n",
            "the concept of a leopard\n",
            "can deal with different kinds of input data,\n",
            "even nonhuman inputs, like genetic sequences,\n",
            "3D clouds of points, as well as images, text and video.\n",
            "The third problem is that today's models are dense.\n",
            "There's a single model,\n",
            "the model is fully activated for every task,\n",
            "for every example that we want to accomplish,\n",
            "whether that's a really simple or a really complicated thing.\n",
            "This, too, is unlike how our own brains work.\n",
            "Different parts of our brains are good at different things,\n",
            "and we're continuously calling upon the pieces of them\n",
            "that are relevant for the task at hand.\n",
            "For example, nervously watching a garbage truck\n",
            "back up towards your car,\n",
            "the part of your brain that thinks about Shakespearean sonnets\n",
            "is probably inactive.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "AI models can work the same way.\n",
            "Instead of a dense model,\n",
            "we can have one that is sparsely activated.\n",
            "So for particular different tasks, we call upon different parts of the model.\n",
            "During training, the model can also learn which parts are good at which things,\n",
            "to continuously identify what parts it wants to call upon\n",
            "in order to accomplish a new task.\n",
            "The advantage of this is we can have a very high-capacity model,\n",
            "but it's very efficient,\n",
            "because we're only calling upon the parts that we need\n",
            "for any given task.\n",
            "So fixing these three things, I think,\n",
            "will lead to a more powerful AI system:\n",
            "instead of thousands of separate models,\n",
            "train a handful of general-purpose models\n",
            "that can do thousands or millions of things.\n",
            "Instead of dealing with single modalities,\n",
            "deal with all modalities,\n",
            "and be able to fuse them together.\n",
            "And instead of dense models, use sparse, high-capacity models,\n",
            "where we call upon the relevant bits as we need them.\n",
            "We've been building a system that enables these kinds of approaches,\n",
            "and we’ve been calling the system “Pathways.”\n",
            "So the idea is this model will be able to do\n",
            "thousands or millions of different tasks,\n",
            "and then, we can incrementally add new tasks,\n",
            "and it can deal with all modalities at once,\n",
            "and then incrementally learn new tasks as needed\n",
            "and call upon the relevant bits of the model\n",
            "for different examples or tasks.\n",
            "And we're pretty excited about this,\n",
            "we think this is going to be a step forward\n",
            "in how we build AI systems.\n",
            "But I also wanted to touch on responsible AI.\n",
            "We clearly need to make sure that this vision of powerful AI systems\n",
            "benefits everyone.\n",
            "These kinds of models raise important new questions\n",
            "about how do we build them with fairness,\n",
            "interpretability, privacy and security,\n",
            "for all users in mind.\n",
            "For example, if we're going to train these models\n",
            "on thousands or millions of tasks,\n",
            "we'll need to be able to train them on large amounts of data.\n",
            "And we need to make sure that data is thoughtfully collected\n",
            "and is representative of different communities and situations\n",
            "all around the world.\n",
            "And data concerns are only one aspect of responsible AI.\n",

            "and, full disclosure, he was my couple’s therapist, too.\n",

            "In other words, can a few simple methods change how much you love someone?\n",
            "The study found that when participants were distracted into thinking\n",

            "like, their favorite hobby or ideal career,\n",
            "their love feelings for their ex stayed the same,\n",

            "does decrease love feelings for your ex.\n",
            "But it also makes you feel \"unpleasant,\"\n",

            "Finally, a third, more zen strategy known as reappraisal of love feelings.\n",
            "For this, participants had to muse over statements like\n",

            "Overall, the researchers concluded,\n",
            "and I'm not using the scientific language here,\n",
            "that concentrating on the bad things about your ex\n",
            "can help you to feel less in love.\n",
            "While distracting yourself with other subjects,\n",
            "as my therapist suggested,\n",
            "can actually make you feel better.\n",

            "most likely you're not going to have the rights to walk out the door with it.\n",
            "But a lot of our policies and a lot of --\n",
            "like, our country was built on this notion\n",
            "that we just have this right to everything, right?\n",

            "So in 1800, the United States is still not much more\n",
            "than just the 13 colonies at that point in history.\n",
            "And it’s the 1800s that are the most deadly century for Indigenous peoples.\n",
            "So a lot of really bad things happened during this time period,\n",
            "because in 1800, in reality,\n",
            "almost all of what is the US is still completely occupied\n",
            "by Indigenous peoples and communities\n",
            "and a huge diversity of them across the board.\n",
            "Even despite European powers having big land claims, you know,\n",
            "France has a big section and Spain's got big chunks\n",
            "and England is holding on to chunks and Russia is coming in\n",
            "and there's all sorts of just big land grabs happening.\n",
            "But in reality, it's the Indigenous communities\n",
            "that have always been there.\n",
            "But this century is a mass century of change, you know.\n",
            "So during this time period, things move really fast.\n",
            "So this is just a really tough time.\n",
            "And for me, this is like my great-grandfather's era\n",
            "because my great-grandfather was born in the late 1850s\n",
            "and during his lifetime, he sees so much change so quickly,\n",
            "he sees so many battles between the Lakota and the US government.\n",
            "He sees the Battle of Little Bighorn when he's 18 years old,\n",

            "So it's such a crazy amount of change to see in one single lifetime, right?\n",
            "And during this time period, people are getting pushed around.\n",
            "At the beginning of that century,\n",
            "over 80 percent of that landmass was under Indigenous control.\n",
            "And by the end of the century less than two percent,\n",
            "only because of the reservation systems.\n",
            "And this is all just part of the story\n",
            "of why there aren't Native American restaurants,\n",

            "let alone evolve, right, when it comes down to all this.\n",
            "So the US history, you know,\n",
            "there's a lot of these big movements like the Indian Removal Act of 1830,\n",
            "the Homestead Act of 1862,\n",
            "the Indian Appropriation Act\n",

            "from D.C. all the way up, basically.\n",

            "the president.\n",
            "They gave the name for a US president: Town Destroyer,\n",
            "which is still the name that they use today\n",
            "because he just devastated a whole area.\n",
            "And this is the precedent that gets set\n",
            "for how the US government treats the Indigenous peoples\n",
            "throughout the next century, basically.\n",
            "So here, in our area, the very systematic destruction of bison,\n",
            "which they knew would hurt a lot of people, and it did.\n",
            "And by the end of the century, there was less than 500 on the planet.\n",
            "And it was very purposeful. So ...\n",
            "But I think what's most damaging for us\n",
            "and why we don't have a lot of Indigenous restaurants out there\n",
            "was the loss of our education,\n",
            "because this whole generation,\n",
            "like my great-grandfather's generation\n",
            "and my grandfather's generation especially,\n",
            "like, those generations should have been getting\n",

            "How to fish, how to hunt, how to gather, how to identify plants,\n",
            "how to live sustainably, utilising plants and animals around us.\n",
            "But instead, we went through a really intense assimilation period\n",
            "where we basically, you know,\n",
            "the boarding school systems\n",
            "stripped this whole generation of all that knowledge and education.\n",
            "And it became very traumatic\n",
            "because this was not a fun situation for these kids to go through.\n",
            "This was a military-style school and they popped up all over the US,\n",

            "forced to learn new religions,\n",
            "forced to learn skills that had nothing to do with them.\n",
            "And being forced to is the situation.\n",
            "You know, a lot of these kids perished.\n",
            "We shouldn't have to worry about sending kids to school\n",
            "to see if they'll survive or not.\n",
            "But this was a very harsh situation for kids to go through.\n",
            "And they went through physical abuse, sexual abuse.\n",
            "They went through mental abuse.\n",
            "And we're still reeling from that in our communities today\n",
            "because of this direct link to the trauma that happened there.\n",
            "And being Indigenous in the 1900s wasn't much better.\n",
            "My grandparents were born before they were even citizens,\n",
            "which doesn't happen until 1924.\n",
            "And then in the 40s and 60s,\n",

            "But basically, anything moving around is literally game.\n",
            "And we cut out beef, pork and chicken because those animals didn't exist here.\n",

            "So there's just a ton of stuff out there.\n",
            "And you shouldn't be afraid of something if it's not a cow, a pig or a chicken\n",
            "because there's a lot of cool foods out there, and even insects,\n",
            "it's so normal in so many parts of the world\n",
            "and it was normal here, too.\n",
            "But for us, our biggest love is plant knowledge\n",

            "The Western diet has never really taken the time\n",
            "to learn this amazing biology that surround us\n",

            "burnout, which originally was inclusive only of the workplace\n",
            "but has expanded now,\n",
            "involves depersonalization,\n",
            "where you separate yourself emotionally from your work\n",
            "instead of investing yourself and feeling like it's meaningful;\n",
            "decreased sense of accomplishment,\n",

            "that what you are doing is making any difference;\n",

            "So let's start at the beginning.\n",
            "Adults have 206 bones\n",
            "that form the main part of the skeletal system.\n",
            "They're the support structure or cage that protects our organs,\n",
            "but they do so much more.\n",
            "They work with our muscles to move our bodies,\n",
            "they store important minerals,\n",
            "they produce hormones,\n",
            "and they even make our blood.\n",
            "Many people think of a Halloween skeleton when they imagine bone,\n",
            "but that only gives us a one-dimensional view.\n",
            "Bone actually has three layers.\n",
            "On the outside, there's the periosteum,\n",
            "a tough membrane that covers and protects.\n",
            "Next, there's a thick layer of compact bone,\n",
            "the white, hard, smooth part that most people are familiar with.\n",
            "But inside, there is spongy or trabecular bone,\n",
            "and an inner core filled with bone marrow,\n",
            "which contains stem cells that make blood\n",
            "and are constantly dividing.\n",
            "Most people understand that our bones grow when we're kids and adolescents.\n",
            "We reach our peak bone mass in our 20s.\n",
            "What many people don't know is even after we stop growing,\n",
            "we are constantly removing old bone\n",
            "and replacing it with new.\n",
            "One estimate is enough bone is removed and replaced\n",
            "that a new skeleton is made every 10 years.\n",
            "After we reach our peak bone mass,\n",
            "bone removal starts to outpace replacement.\n",
            "This can eventually affect the integrity of the bone\n",
            "and it lowers the bone mass or the amount of bone that we have.\n",
            "The bone disease osteoporosis is an extreme version of this process.\n",

            "that even small bumps or falls can create fractures.\n",
            "Another cool fact about bones is they store calcium,\n",
            "so if intake is low, meaning not enough in our diet,\n",
            "the body draws calcium from the bone.\n",
            "This can also contribute to bone loss,\n",
            "so we need enough dietary calcium to maintain our bone.\n",
            "Vitamin D fits into the picture\n",
            "because it helps our body absorb calcium.\n",
            "When we think of calcium and vitamin D,\n",
            "many of us picture a frosty glass of milk.\n",
            "Milk is not the only good source of calcium out there.\n",
            "Humans are creative omnivores.\n",
            "We can get calcium from a lot of other sources --\n",

            "However, some people may need supplements.\n",
            "Another important factor for bone health is exercise.\n",
            "Mechanical loading stimulates the cells that build bone\n",
            "and muscles pulling on the bone may do this as well.\n",
            "In fact, any activity that puts stress on your bones,\n",
            "like walking, jogging, dancing, racket sports,\n",
            "even strength training like doing weights,\n",
            "stimulates extra deposits of calcium\n",

            "The body builds up the lining in the uterus, the endometrium,\n",

        "video_description": "You may have heard that you should be pooping once a day -- but that's a load of crap, says Dr. Jen Gunter. From the enzymes in your mouth to the nutrient-absorbing power of your large intestine, she journeys through the digestive tract to explain why it's okay to poop at your own pace -- and shares the many regulating benefits of a fiber-rich diet. \n\nThink you know how your body works? Think again! Dr. Jen Gunter is here to shake up everything you thought you knew -- from how much water you need to drink to how often you need to poop and everything in between.

            "Let me take you through the journey from food to poop.\n",
            "Digestion actually starts in the mouth.\n",
            "Chewing breaks the food down into smaller particles.\n",
            "As you eat, your food mixes with saliva,\n",
            "which moistens the food,\n",
            "and has enzymes that start to break down those starches and fats.\n",
            "Contractions in your esophagus push the food to your stomach,\n",
            "where acid and gastric juices and enzymes further break the food down.\n",
            "The food then travels to the small intestine,\n",
            "where fats, proteins, carbohydrates and micronutrients\n",
            "are further broken down, with help from the pancreas, gallbladder, liver\n",
            "and the microbiome,\n",
            "so they can be absorbed across the small intestine\n",
            "and sent to the liver for processing.\n",
            "What's left moves to the large intestine or the colon,\n",
            "which has three main jobs:\n",
            "absorbing water and electrolytes, producing and absorbing vitamins\n",
            "and forming and squeezing the material, now called stool,\n",
            "towards the rectum.\n",
            "When the rectum is full, it sends a signal to the brain,\n",
            "and the brain takes into account whether it's a socially acceptable time to poop,\n",
            "and if it is, it sends a signal to the anal sphincter muscles to relax.\n",
            "And boom, you know what happens next.\n",
            "This process involves more than 10 organs\n",
            "and typically takes anywhere from 24 to 120 hours\n",
            "in healthy people.\n",
            "So it's helpful to think of poop as exactly what it is --\n",
            "all the stuff that doesn't get digested in this process.\n",
            "It is water, bacteria, dead cells and mucus,\n",
            "all glommed together with fiber.\n",
            "Fiber is amazing.\n",
            "It affects the digestive tract from top to bottom.\n",
            "It is very simply a carbohydrate the body can't absorb.\n",
            "While other carbs are broken down into sugars,\n",
            "fiber passes by sort of moseying along, doing all kinds of cool things.\n",
            "High-fiber foods physically take longer to eat,\n",
            "so they help us pace our meals.\n",
            "The bulk also slows down digestion, especially in the stomach,\n",
            "and makes you feel full longer.\n",
            "Fiber also draws water into the stool, keeping it soft.\n",
            "Scratchy, hard stool is, to put it mildly, unpleasant.\n",
            "It also increases bacterial mass.\n",
            "The water and bacteria together increase the bulk of the stool,\n",
            "which helps it move along.\n",
            "Fiber also slows absorption of sugars into the bloodstream\n",
            "and reduces absorption of fats and cholesterols.\n",
            "And as fiber collects in your colon,\n",
            "it feeds all your good gut bacteria,\n",
            "helping you maintain a healthy microbiome.\n",
            "Fiber is associated with the reduced risk of diabetes,\n",
            "heart disease, several gastrointestinal conditions\n",
            "and even certain cancers.\n",
            "And yet, most of us aren't getting enough of it.\n",
            "For example, in the US,\n",
            "the vast majority of adults\n",
            "aren't eating the recommended 28 grams of fiber per day.\n",
            "In fact, the average American just gets 15 grams of fiber a day.\n",
            "So how exactly do you get more fiber?\n",
            "The generic answer is to eat more whole grains,\n",
            "fruits, vegetables and legumes.\n",
            "But I want you to consider some more specific fiber-rich foods\n",
            "that I personally love:\n",
            "pears, raspberries and blackberries, avocados and artichokes,\n",
            "high-fiber cereals, whole grains -- my favorite is farro --\n",
            "lentils, kidney beans and chickpeas.\n",

            "[Your Money and Your Mind with Wendy De La Rosa]\n",
            "One online gimmick that sites use is gamification,\n",
            "and this is where websites use game design elements\n",
            "to get you to spend more time and more money on their sites.\n",
            "Now, some sites have a virtual wheel for you to spin\n",
            "to get a chance at that day's discounts.\n",
            "Others, they let you accrue loyalty points\n",
            "based on how you interact with the site.\n",
            "And that kind of gamification, in my mind, is really dangerous.\n",
            "In one classic experiment,\n",
            "lab rats were more captivated by the random chance of pushing a lever\n",
            "and receiving a food pellet\n",
            "than by the certainty of a fixed food schedule.\n",
            "And we as humans are just the same.\n",
            "We're enticed by the chance to win.\n",
            "Just like at a slot machine in Vegas,\n",
            "you increase your dopamine levels every time you try your luck.\n",
            "So my tip here is to avoid temptation altogether\n",
            "by unsubscribing from online shopping emails.\n",
            "You can't buy what you can't see,\n",
            "and these emails are constant reminders\n",
            "that are intended to lure us back to the site\n",
            "with its gamifications and its gimmick,\n",
            "when you'd otherwise not be thinking about them.\n",
            "A second tactic online retailers use is scarcity.\n",
            "Many sites now tell you\n",
            "how many other customers are also viewing the same item,\n",
            "making it seem like that item is very popular,\n",
            "and it's likely to go quickly.\n",
            "Similarly, websites will use a timer for your basket,\n",
            "pushing and pushing the message\n",
            "that these potential items won't be available for long.\n",
            "Research shows that the perceptions of a product's scarcity\n",
            "can increase its value in the eye of the shopper\n",
            "and increase a shopper's willingness to buy.\n",
            "Scarcity can also make people feel more competitive and selfish as well.\n",
            "So here's my tip to help you combat scarcity:\n",
            "when scarcity is tempting you,\n",
            "back away from the website, back away from the car\n",
            "and sleep on it.\n",
            "That can help you decide whether or not you really need\n",
            "whatever it is that you were planning on buying.\n",
            "Leave the site for at least an entire day\n",
            "and see if you're still itching for the item.\n",
            "This approach works best if you use an incognito browser\n",
            "so you won't be haunted by the ads for the product\n",
            "everywhere you go.\n",
            "The third tactic that companies use\n",

Poetry is for everyone, she says, and at its core it's all about connection and collaboration. In this fierce talk and performance, she explains why poetry is inherently political, pays homage to her honorary ancestors and stresses the value of speaking out despite your fears. \"Poetry has never been the language of barriers,\" Gorman says. \"It's always been the language of bridges.\"\n\nVisit ",

            "This was happening everywhere.\n",

            "for youth ages 10 to 24 in Oregon.\n",
            "The second leading cause.\n",
            "We knew we had to do something.\n",
            "So over the next few months,\n",
            "we made a committee called Students for a Healthy Oregon,\n",

            "and a whole lot worse --\n",
            "kind of like those days my mom gave me when I was younger.\n",
            "So over the next few months,\n",
            "we lobbied and researched and campaigned for our bill,\n",
            "and in June of 2019 it was finally signed into law.\n",

            "This was a groundbreaking moment for Oregon students.\n",
            "Here's an example of how this is playing out now.\n",

            "they're falling behind in school, and they know they need help.\n",
            "Maybe they've never talked about mental health with their parents before,\n",
            "but now they have a law on their side to help initiate that conversation.\n",
            "The parent still needs to be the one to call the school and excuse the absence,\n",
            "so it's not like it's a free pass for the kids,\n",
            "but most importantly,\n",
            "now that school has that absence recorded as a mental health day,\n",
            "so they can keep track\n",
            "of just how many students take how many mental health days.\n",
            "If a student takes too many,\n",
            "they'll be referred to the school counselor for a check-in.\n",
            "This is important because we can catch students who are struggling\n",
            "before it's too late.\n",
            "One of the main things we heard at that forum in 2018\n",
            "is that oftentimes stepping forward and getting help is the hardest step.\n",
            "We're hoping that this law can help with that.\n",
            "This not only will start teaching kids young how to take care of themselves\n",
            "and practice self-care and stress management,\n",
            "but it could also literally save lives.\n",
            "Now students from multiple other states are also trying to pass these laws.\n",
            "I'm currently working with students in both California and Colorado\n",
            "to do the same,\n",
            "because we believe that students everywhere\n",
            "deserve a chance to feel better.\n",
            "Aside from all the practical reasons and technicalities,\n",
            "House Bill 2191 is really special because of the core concept behind it:\n",
            "that physical and mental health are equal and should be treated as such.\n",
            "In fact, they're connected.\n",
            "Take health care for example.\n",
            "Think about CPR.\n",
            "If you were put in a situation where you had to administer CPR,\n",
            "would you know at least a little bit of what to do?\n",
            "Think to yourself --\n",
            "most likely yes because CPR trainings are offered in most schools, workplaces\n",
            "and even online.\n",
            "We even have songs that go with it.\n",
            "But how about mental health care?\n",
            "I know I was trained in CPR in my seventh-grade health class.\n",
            "What if I was trained in seventh grade how to manage my mental health\n",
            "or how to respond to a mental health crisis?\n",
            "I'd love to see a world where each of us has a toolkit of skills\n",
            "to help a friend, coworker, family member\n",
            "or even stranger going through a mental health crisis.\n",
            "And these resources should be especially available in schools\n",
            "because that's where students are struggling the most.\n",
            "The other concept that I sincerely hope you take with you today\n",
            "is that it is always OK to not be OK,\n",
            "and it is always OK to take a break.\n",
            "It doesn't have to be a whole day;\n",
            "sometimes that's not realistic.\n",
            "But it can be a few moments here and there to check in with yourself.\n",
            "Think of life like a race ...\n",
            "like a long-distance race.\n",
            "If you sprint in the very beginning you're going to get burnt out.\n",
            "You may even hurt yourself from pushing too hard.\n",
            "But if you pace yourself,\n",

            "and you push yourself other times,\n",
            "you are sure to be way more successful.\n",
            "So please,\n",

            "they still struggle to identify their passion.\n",
            "And here I was as a 30-year-old,\n",

            "and turning it into a career.\n",

            "or at least until you're ready to retire.\"\n",
            "Because there's a notion that looking inward\n",

            "is a luxury that only the rich can enjoy,\n",
            "or a pleasure that only the retired can indulge in.\n",
            "Which made me wonder:\n",
            "Is passion only for the rich,\n",
            "or an experience only the retired can enjoy?\n",
            "For many of us, we've been led to believe\n",

            "I knew that I was not entitled to anything.\n",
            "Every opportunity was a privilege.\n",
            "And so when I thought about quitting,\n",
            "it was a huge risk.\n",
            "I was given two alternatives,\n",
            "which are the most popular in Africa.\n",
            "The first one is sign up for any course at a vocational institution and do it.\n",
            "My second option, settle for any job offer you can get,\n",
            "no matter the working conditions,\n",
            "and do it.\n",
            "That probably explains why we have so many of our young people\n",
            "being trafficked in search of greener pastures.\n",
            "I opted for the first option.\n",
            "I did look at a couple vocational institutions\n",
            "in the hope that I would find a course that resonated with my persona,\n",
            "my dream and my aspiration.\n",
            "I was disappointed to learn that there was no room for misfits like me\n",
            "in these institutions.\n",
            "The education system in many parts of the world\n",
            "has been designed around preselected options\n",
            "that young people are expected to fit in or risk becoming misfits.\n",
            "And so going through school, I was nurtured and conditioned\n",
            "to think in the straight line and stay within the straight line.\n",
            "But when I dropped out, I discovered a world of possibilities.\n",
            "I knew I could be anything, I could study anything,\n",
            "and so I leveraged free online courses.\n",
            "That's how I built my CV, got into employment\n",
            "and worked for eight years.\n",
            "And after eight years,\n",
            "I told myself there must be more to life\n",
            "than just going through the routines of life.\n",
            "So in 2014, I started an organization called Kyusa\n",
            "where we are working with out-of-school youth\n",
            "and empowering them to turn their passions\n",
            "into profitable, scalable and sustainable businesses.\n",
            "Now, when we talk about passion,\n",
            "one of the most common questions that people ask is, \"What is passion?\n",
            "How do I even find it?\"\n",
            "And in the simplest definition,\n",
            "passion is a collection of your life experiences\n",
            "that give you the deepest sense of fulfillment.\n",
            "And to identify your passion, you need to look inward.\n",
            "So we use two reflective questions.\n",
            "The first question we ask is,\n",
            "\"If you had all the time and the money in the world,\n",
            "what would you spend your time doing?\"\n",
            "It sounds like a very simple question,\n",
            "but many people struggle to answer this question\n",
            "because they've just never thought about it.\n",
            "The second question we ask\n",
            "is, \"What makes you happy\n",
            "or gives you the deepest sense of fulfillment?\"\n",
            "Now, you would assume that we all know what makes us happy,\n",
            "but it's also interesting to note that so many people have no idea\n",
            "what makes them happy,\n",
            "because they are so busy going through the routines of life,\n",
            "they've never stopped to look inward.\n",
            "And so identifying the things that give us a deep sense of fulfillment\n",
            "and the things that give us deep joy\n",
            "are thoughts that begin to direct us in the direction of our passion.\n",
            "And just in case you're wondering\n",
            "what your answers are to those two questions,\n",
            "I invite you to sit with these questions later and just reflect about it.\n",
            "However, I am also aware\n",
            "that passion alone cannot guarantee success in life.\n",
            "And I should note\n",
            "that not every passion can become a career.\n",
            "For passion to become a career,\n",
            "it must be coupled with the right set of skills, conditioning and positioning.\n",
            "So when we get our young people to look inward,\n",
            "we also ask them what skills do you have,\n",
            "what talents do you have, what experience do you have\n",
            "that you can use to build a niche in the marketplace.\n",
            "But more than that, we also look at the market trends,\n",
            "because it doesn't matter how much you love and enjoy it.\n",
            "If nobody wants it or is willing to pay for it,\n",
            "it can't be a career.\n",
            "It's just a hobby.\n",
            "And the third thing we look at is how do you position yourself?\n",
            "Who are you targeting? Who do you want to sell to?\n",
            "Why would they want to buy from you?\n",
            "And so the combination of the three is what enables you to move\n",
            "from just a passion to a business.\n",
            "And many of our young people have been able to turn their ideas\n",
            "and burning desires into profitable businesses\n",
            "or social enterprises,\n",
            "and they're not just creating jobs,\n",
            "but they are solving societal challenges.\n",
            "I'll share with you two examples.\n",
            "One of them is Esther.\n",
            "I met Esther two years ago.\n",
            "She had been out of school for two years,\n",
            "and she had been deeply affected by her dropping out.\n",
            "As a result, she had experienced severe depression\n",
            "to a point where she attempted to take her own life several times.\n",
            "Her friends and family didn't know what to do for her.\n",
            "They simply prayed for her.\n",
            "When I met Esther and I started to converse with her,\n",
            "I asked her a simple question.\n",
            "I said, \"If you had all the time and the money in the world,\n",
            "what would you do?\"\n",
            "Without thinking or hesitation,\n",
            "her eyes lit up and she began to tell me\n",
            "how she wanted to change the lives of young people.\n",
            "She wanted to restore hope and dignity to other teenagers\n",
            "by helping them make informed decisions about life.\n",
            "I was certain of the fact that this burning desire in her\n",
            "was unquenchable.\n",
            "And so we worked with Esther to put a framework around this desire.\n",
            "Today, she runs a social enterprise in her village,\n",
            "raising awareness about substance abuse, mental health, sexual reproductive health\n",
            "and is helping other school dropouts acquire vocational skills,\n",
            "so they can make a living for themselves.\n",
            "Esther turned 20 this year,\n",
            "and for the last two years, she has organized an annual teen fest\n",
            "that brings together over 500 teenagers.\n",
            "(Applause)\n",
            "Young people that are able to network and collaborate\n",
            "on different projects,\n",
            "but more importantly to meet professionals they would otherwise never have met.\n",
            "This is all engineered by a girl that believed the world had no room for her,\n",
            "that without education she would never amount to anything.\n",
            "But by looking inward and tapping into a burning desire,\n",
            "putting structure around it,\n",
            "it has become a model that not only changed her life\n",
            "but is transforming the lives of hundreds of young people every year.\n",
            "My other example is Musa.\n",
            "Musa is a natural artistic guy.\n",
            "He's the kind that would look at any design and replicate it with ease.\n",
            "And so he seeks to recognize that ability in him.\n",
            "When I met Musa, he was doing all kinds of crafts --\n",
            "bags, belts, wallets --\n",
            "but it was more of a part-time thing.\n",
            "Or sometimes, if he was really broke and needed to make quick money,\n",
            "then he would come up with a design and sell it.\n",
            "But he had never thought of it as a business.\n",
            "We started working with Musa,\n",
            "helping him shift his mindset from a hobby to a business\n",
            "and beginning to rethink how he can make products that he could sell\n",
            "and even be able to scale.\n",
            "Musa makes some of the most amazing bags I've ever seen,\n",
            "and over the last one year, Musa's business has grown.\n",
            "He has been recognized in different places.\n",
            "Currently, he's talking about exporting to developed countries.\n",
            "Musa, like any other dropout,\n",
            "believed that without academic credentials,\n",
            "he wouldn't amount to anything.\n",

            "So we are going to start in 1891,\n",
            "when a German scientist was looking through a microscope\n",
            "at insect cells.\n",
            "And he saw something kind of funny.\n",
            "At the center of the cells, there was this dark stuff.\n",
            "No one had ever seen it before.\n",
            "And he noticed that as the cells would multiply and divide,\n",
            "it would go into some of the new cells\n",
            "but not the others.\n",
            "He didn't know what it was, so he gave it a really great name.\n",
            "He called it the \"X element.\"\n",

            "And he was like, \"We'll just fill in that X later.\"\n",
            "And then, fast-forward 10 years later,\n",
            "and there is an American scientist,\n",
            "and she is looking through her microscope,\n",
            "also at insect cells.\n",
            "And she sees something funny.\n",
            "There's more of this dark stuff.\n",
            "And it's kind of tiny,\n",
            "it's hanging out near the X element.\n",
            "And eventually, someone was like,\n",
            "\"Well, if that one thing's called X,\n",
            "should we call this other thing Y?\"\n",
            "And like that, (Snaps fingers)\n",
            "the sex chromosomes had been discovered.\n",
            "So chromosomes,\n",
            "you probably all know what they are,\n",
            "but I will tell you anyways.\n",

            "geneticist Melissa Wilson broke it down for me like this.\n",
            "(Audio) Melissa Wilson: Typically, you'll get one copy of every chromosome\n",
            "from your genetic mom\n",
            "and one copy of every chromosome from your genetic dad,\n",
            "and we have 22 of these\n",

            "one through 22,\n",
            "we do not call X and Y 23.\n",
            "I like to think that they are waiting for, like, a LeBron James to come along.\n",
            "But in this instance, they were like,\n",
            "\"We're just going to keep the letters,\n",
            "and then we'll give them a title.\"\n",
            "They called them the sex chromosomes.\n",
            "Now I would wager that in the United States,\n",
            "these are the most well-known chromosomes\n",
            "for one simple fact:\n",
            "that we say X equals \"girl,\" and Y equals \"boy\" --\n",
            "that they are responsible for sex.\n",
            "And -- and I had to learn this --\n",
            "but when I'm talking about \"sex\" here,\n",
            "I'm talking about the way biology gives us gonads,\n",
            "which are our ovaries and our testes --\n",
            "I'm not talking about gender, which is how we identify.\n",
            "And so, as a reporter at the show --\n",
            "\"Radiolab,\" the audio documentary program I work for --\n",
            "I was like, what's up with these sex chromosomes?\n",
            "You know, that's kind of my job, I think things are weird,\n",

            "And in this case, a lot of people answered.\n",
            "And in the two years I had of reporting on X and Y,\n",

            "I ended up doing for \"Radiolab,\"\n",
            "I found out that these two chromosomes live in a world that is unexpected,\n",
            "a little unsettling;\n",
            "where things that I thought were facts\n",
            "were, like, twisted in ways I hadn't seen before.\n",

            "So, you're you all,\n",
            "we're all going to talk about it.\n",
            "And for me,\n",
            "the true story of X and Y starts with their name.\n",
            "So within years of being discovered,\n",
            "these two little chromosomes had acquired more than 10 different names.\n",
            "There was diplosome and heterochromosome\n",
            "and idiochromosome,\n",
            "and most of the names had to do with their structure, their shape,\n",
            "their size.\n",
            "And then there was \"sex chromosome,\"\n",
            "which they had been given because of the fact\n",
            "that we had started seeing that the X would go with the females,\n",
            "and the Y would often go with the males.\n",
            "But scientists were like,\n",
            "\"Do we really want to call them sex chromosomes?\"\n",
            "And science historian Sarah Richardson is the one who told me this story.\n",
            "(Audio) Sarah Richardson: For three decades, scientists were like,\n",
            "\"You should not call them the sex chromosomes.\n",
            "The X and Y have many functions,\n",
            "and you wouldn't assume that a single chromosome\n",
            "controls a single trait.\n",
            "Imagine calling one chromosome the 'urogenital chromosome,'\n",
            "or the 'liver chromosome.'\"\n",
            "MW: Scientists, if you dig into the history --\n",
            "it's really cool, you should --\n",
            "were hesitant to, like, commit to such a specific name\n",
            "and such a powerfully connotated name.\n",
            "There was a fear that it would actually be really limiting --\n",
            "maybe to science, maybe to society --\n",
            "but the fear was in the room.\n",
            "And you can see they ended up getting \"sex chromosome\" --\n",
            "it's like a pretty juicy title,\n",
            "it popularized genetics, you know?\n",
            "But in the 100-year history since we settled on that name,\n",
            "you can see it starts to get a little complicated.\n",
            "So around 1960 --\n",
            "this is going to be our first stop\n",
            "on the complicated world of the sex chromosomes --\n",
            "so around 1960,\n",
            "we had discovered that you could be XYY.\n",
            "They discovered an XYY man.\n",
            "And to digress a little here,\n",
            "it turns out that the model of \"X equals girl and Y equals boy\"\n",
            "is really simplistic.\n",
            "You can actually be a whole bunch of different combinations of X and Y,\n",
            "giving you, like, different types of biological sex.\n",
            "You could be two Xs and two Ys together.\n",
            "You could be four Xs, you could be five Xs,\n",
            "you could be XO.\n",
            "And so I thought that was pretty crazy,\n",
            "because I was like,\n",
            "\"Wow, this really upends a model of biological sex\n",
            "I think most of us in this room have been taught.\"\n",
            "So a few years after they realized that you can be XYY,\n",
            "researchers go to a prison in Scotland,\n",
            "and they do genetic analysis of a bunch of the male prisoners.\n",
            "And they find a number of people who are XYY.\n",
            "And according to Sarah:\n",
            "(Audio) SR: They just rushed to publish a theory\n",
            "suggesting that this extra Y chromosome\n",
            "could explain criminality in some men.\n",
            "MW: Yeah.\n",
            "So the logic goes like this:\n",
            "By this point, we're thinking Y is male.\n",
            "We think male is aggressive,\n",
            "so Y must be aggression.\n",
            "If you've got an extra Y, you must be crazy.\n",
            "And like, we went nuts with this theory.\n",
            "We called it the supermale,\n",
            "they started scanning more prisoners,\n",
            "serial killers, boys.\n",
            "And in all seriousness,\n",
            "there was actually a suggestion that we consider aborting XYY fetuses.\n",
            "So in 1980,\n",
            "this theory pretty much toppled, for a number of reasons.\n",
            "One,\n",
            "there had been this really large study\n",
            "that basically showed there was no connection\n",
            "between Y and violence,\n",
            "I think we all saw that coming.\n",
            "And then, there was one other thing.\n",
            "(Audio) SR: Going back and looking at those original findings\n",
            "in that high-security psychiatric institution,\n",
            "they had also found a high number of individuals\n",
            "with an extra X chromosome.\n",
            "So these are XXY, as opposed to XYY.\n",
            "(Audio) MW: Really?\n",
            "(Audio) SR: Yeah. Now, they never claimed\n",
            "that the individuals with an extra X chromosome\n",
            "were superfemales.\n",
            "They never investigated whether they had higher rates of violence.\n",
            "MW: Seems like kind of an oversight.\n",
            "I don't know.\n",
            "But I think it's interesting,\n",
            "because what you see is if you start looking at these chromosomes\n",
            "through the lens of sex,\n",
            "what naturally falls in place behind\n",
            "is we look at them through the lens of gender,\n",
            "and the traits that we associate with gender.\n",
            "So men were violent,\n",
            "and Y explained why they were in prison.\n",
            "The X did not do that,\n",
            "because like, you know, what's X?\n",
            "We don't associate it with violence.\n",
            "And while we don't believe in supermales today --\n",
            "God, I hope we don't --\n",
            "we don't believe in supermales today,\n",
            "there is a very similar conversation that's still happening\n",
            "around inherent violence in boys and biology.\n",
            "So my next stop on the weird world of X and Y,\n",
            "or things feeling a little topsy-turvy, is 1985.\n",
            "The World University Games were set to happen in Japan,\n",
            "and the Spanish hurdler María José Martínez-Patiño was scheduled to run.\n",
            "She was like a hot shot, a rising superstar.\n",
            "And the night before her race, they had her DNA scanned.\n",
            "Now at the time, this was a thing that they were doing,\n",
            "because they were like,\n",
            "\"OK, we don't want men covertly racing as women,\n",
            "so we're going to scan the women\n",
            "and make sure all their Xs line up.\"\n",
            "And so I heard this story from Ruth Padawer\n",
            "who was a New York Times Magazine reporter\n",
            "and she reported on María.\n",
            "(Audio) Ruth Padawer: So they tell her the chromosome test results were abnormal.\n",
            "Although on the outside, she was fully female,\n",
            "she had XY chromosomes and these internal testes.\n",
            "MW: They were like,\n",
            "\"We hate to break it to you, María, but you're actually a dude.\n",
            "You can't race with the ladies.\"\n",
            "(Audio) RP: And so she's thrown off the national team,\n",
            "she's expelled from the athletics residence,\n",
            "she's denied her scholarship,\n",
            "a bunch of her friends dump her,\n",
            "fellow athletes abandon her,\n",
            "she loses her medals, her records are revoked.\n",
            "MW: So it turns out --\n",
            "remember when I told you\n",
            "you can be a bunch of different combinations of X and Y --\n",
            "you can also be XY and be female.\n",
            "You can be XX and male.\n",
            "In María's case, she was something called androgen insensitive.\n",
            "Which means that she did have some sort of internal testes --\n",
            "they were making testosterone --\n",
            "but her body couldn't use it.\n",
            "And so if you thought of testosterone as, like, a superpower,\n",
            "she was not benefiting from it.\n",
            "And so eventually,\n",
            "sports authorities, like, let her back in,\n",
            "but her career was done.\n",
            "And in this instance you see how,\n",
            "if you assign sex to a specific place in the body,\n",
            "or at least, like, this is what I saw, right?\n",
            "If you assign sex to a specific place in the body,\n",
            "it somehow makes us think that we can go into a body,\n",
            "look at a specific place\n",
            "and tell someone we know something more about them\n",
            "than they know about themselves.\n",
            "And that feels terrifying to me.\n",
            "And we don't genetically test female athletes anymore,\n",
            "but you can see very similar conversations happening\n",
            "when we talk about testosterone in sports,\n",
            "you can also see it in suggestions that we take transgender individuals\n",
            "and we genetically analyze them and we tell them who they are.\n",
            "That is real,\n",
            "that is a conversation that has happened recently.\n",
            "The last place that I'll share with you\n",
            "where these chromosomes got complicated for me\n",

            "I then came upon the epiphany\n",
            "that it takes years if not tens of thousands of hours\n",
            "to get really good at something.\n",
            "I really didn't have a lot of time to waste.\n",
            "This talk isn't for those looking to quit their job\n",
            "because they don't like their boss or they had a long day at work.\n",
            "This is for those that are ready to make the completely scary leap\n",
            "into a brand-new career.\n",
            "So as you think about making a career change,\n",
            "here are a few tips I hope you consider\n",
            "and a few things I've picked up along the way.\n",
            "First, there's three things to think about before you're ready to move on.\n",
            "Number one: professional life is about learning.\n",
            "If you're not even interested in learning anymore,\n",
            "that's a huge red flag\n",
            "that there might not be a future for you in that industry.\n",
            "Number two: career changes are often gut-driven.\n",
            "If you constantly have sleepless nights\n",
            "where you're wide awake staring at the ceiling thinking,\n",
            "\"Oh, man. I can't live with myself if I never try to make this change\n",
            "or if I don't even actually investigate it,\"\n",
            "then trust your gut.\n",
            "It might be time for that career change.\n",
            "On the flip side,\n",
            "one reason to not move on is short-term pain.\n",
            "If you don't like your boss\n",
            "or people at the office are grating on you,\n",
            "that's actually not a good reason to absolutely change your career,\n",
            "because when you do change a career,\n",
            "you generally have to start from the bottom,\n",
            "and you'll probably feel a lot of short-term pain,\n",
            "whether it's through a lack of salary or lack of a title.\n",
            "Pain at any job is inevitable.\n",
            "So now you're convinced that it's time to change your career.\n",
            "Then there's three things to do immediately.\n",
            "First: network, network, network.\n",
            "No one ever builds a career without a good mentor\n",
            "or a good support network.\n",
            "What I mean by networking is getting all the great advice\n",
            "that you can possibly get.\n",
            "Technology has made it so simple to reach out to new people\n",
            "to say, \"Hey, I'm thinking about making a career change.\n",
            "Do you have just five minutes to chat with me?\"\n",
            "That passion and that hunger and that ability to be a sponge\n",
            "really attracts awesome mentors\n",
            "and people willing to give you their time\n",
            "to give you some good advice.\n",
            "So go out there and meet new people.\n",
            "The second thing you need to do immediately\n",
            "is shore up your finances.\n",
            "The reality is, when you change your career,\n",
            "you'll either start with a job with a lower title\n",
            "or lower pay or maybe even no pay,\n",
            "especially if you're starting your own business.\n",
            "So going out there and making sure your finances are in order\n",
            "to make the transition less painful\n",
            "is really, really important.\n",
            "For me personally, as I made the transition from being an attorney\n",
            "over to a video game creator,\n",
            "I wanted to have at least six to 12 months of personal runway in the bank.\n",
            "Six to 12 months might not be the right number for you,\n",
            "but be honest with yourself on what that number should be.\n",
            "Number three, if you're not ready to make the full jump right at this moment,\n",
            "then get your side hustle on.\n",
            "Side hustles could be anything from volunteering with an organization\n",
            "that's in the new industry you want to go into,\n",
            "could be starting your business part-time on the weekends.\n",
            "It's a free way to get a taste to see if you really love something.\n",
            "So you're ready to make the move\n",
            "or maybe you already made the move.\n",
            "Here are three things you should think about doing, right now.\n",
            "One: do not -- I repeat -- do not burn bridges.\n",
            "You spent years building those bridges,\n",
            "why burn them now?\n",
            "The world is such a small place,\n",
            "especially with all these online platforms,\n",
            "that, believe me, you will see these people again\n",
            "and probably in the most inopportune times.\n",
            "Number two: take stock of what you've learned\n",
            "in your previous career or careers.\n",
            "Most likely, a lot of those things are really applicable\n",
            "to your new job and your new career,\n",
            "whether it's interacting with people, playing on a team\n",
            "or dealing with jerks and assholes.\n",
            "All those things are really universally applicable.\n",
            "You'll find jerks no matter what industry you're in;\n",
            "no one's immune to it, everyone's got to figure it out,\n",
            "and you probably know how to do it already.\n",
            "Lastly, when you start your new job, you're going to be nervous.\n",
            "But don't worry, take a deep breath,\n",
            "because this is what I want to tell you:\n",
            "you're part of a new team now,\n",
            "and everyone around you is rooting for your success,\n",
            "because your success is their success.\n",
            "So welcome to your new career.\n"

            "Let me give you a glimpse\n",

            "First, it is essential to guarantee privacy and confidentiality\n",
            "of data and information.\n",
            "This is achieved through a strong digital identity\n",
            "that is issued by the state\n",
            "and compatible with everything.\n",
            "In fact, every Estonian has one.\n",
            "The identity is doubled with a strong digital signature\n",
            "that is accepted, used and legally binding\n",
            "both in Estonia and the European Union.\n",
            "When the system can properly and securely identify who is using it,\n",
            "after logging in, it will provide access to the personal data of the citizen\n",
            "and all the public services within one tool,\n",
            "and allow to authorize anything by signing digitally.\n",
            "A second principle, and one of the most transformative,\n",
            "is called \"Once only.\"\n",
            "It means that the state cannot ask for the same data\n",
            "more than once,\n",
            "nor can store it in more than one place.\n",
            "For instance,\n",
            "if you've already provided your birth or marital certificate\n",
            "to the population registry,\n",
            "this is the only place where this data is going to be held.\n",
            "And no other institution will be ever asking for it again.\n",
            "Once only is a very powerful rule,\n",
            "as it defines the whole structure of the data collection in a country,\n",
            "what information is collected\n",
            "and who is responsible for maintaining it,\n",
            "making sure we avoid centralization of data,\n",
            "duplication of data,\n",
            "and guarantee that it's actually up to date.\n",
            "This distributed approach also avoids the problem\n",
            "of the single point of failure.\n",
            "But since the data cannot be replicated,\n",
            "or collected more than once,\n",
            "it means that the design has to keep in mind\n",
            "secure and robust access to that information at all times,\n",
            "so the public institution can offer a service.\n",
            "This is exactly the role of the data exchange platform\n",
            "called the X-Road\n",
            "that has been in use since 2001.\n",
            "Just like a highway,\n",
            "it connects public sector databases and registries,\n",
            "local municipalities and businesses,\n",
            "organizing a real-time, secure and regulated data exchange,\n",
            "saving an auditable trace after each move.\n",
            "Here's a screenshot of a live feed\n",
            "showing all the requests performed on the X-Road\n",
            "and all the services that it actually facilitates.\n",
            "And this is the real picture\n",
            "of all the connections between public and private sector databases.\n",
            "As you can see,\n",
            "there is no central database whatsoever.\n",
            "Confidentiality and privacy are definitely very important.\n",
            "But in the digital world,\n",
            "reliability and integrity of information\n",
            "is just critical for operations.\n",
            "For instance,\n",
            "if someone changes your medical health record,\n",
            "let's say allergies,\n",
            "without you or your doctor knowing,\n",
            "treatment could be deadly.\n",
            "That's why in a digital society, a system like an Estonian one,\n",
            "when there's almost no paper originals,\n",
            "there's almost only digital originals,\n",
            "integrity of data,\n",
            "data exchange rules, software components\n",
            "and log files is paramount.\n",
            "We use a form of blockchain that we invented back in 2007,\n",
            "way before blockchain even became a thing,\n",
            "to check and guarantee the integrity of data in real time.\n",
            "Blockchain is our auditor\n",
            "and a promise that no access to the data\n",
            "or data manipulation remains unrecorded.\n",
            "Data ownership is another key principle in the design of the system.\n",
            "Aren't you worried by the fact that governments, tech companies\n",
            "and other businesses around the world\n",
            "claim data they've collected about you is theirs,\n",
            "generally refuse to give access to that information,\n",
            "and often fail to prove how it was used\n",
            "or shared with third parties?\n",
            "I don't know, for me it seems like a quite disturbing situation.\n",
            "The Estonian system is based on the principle\n",
            "that an individual is the owner of the data collected about him,\n",
            "thus has an absolute right to know what information is collected\n",
            "and who has been accessing it.\n",
            "Every time a policeman, a doctor or any state officer\n",
            "is accessing personal information of the citizens online,\n",
            "first they only get to access it after logging in\n",
            "to the information they're authorized to see to do their job.\n",
            "And secondly, every time they're making requests,\n",
            "this is saved in a log file.\n",
            "This detailed log file is part of the state public services\n",
            "and allows real transparency,\n",
            "making sure no privacy violation will remain unnoticed to the citizen.\n",
            "Now, of course, this is only a simplified summary\n",
            "of all the design principles that e-Estonia is built on.\n",
            "And now, government is building up\n",
            "to get ready for use of artificial intelligence\n",
            "and building a whole new generation of public services --\n",
            "proactive services\n",
            "that would activate seamlessly\n",
            "based on different life situations that people might be in,\n",
            "such as childbirth, unemployment or starting a business.\n",
            "Now, of course,\n",
            "running a digital society with no paper backup\n",
            "can be an issue, right?\n",
            "Even though we trust our systems to be solid,\n",
            "but one can never be too cautious as we experienced back in 2007,\n",
            "when the first cyberincident happened,\n",
            "and it literally blocked part of our networks,\n",
            "making access to the services impossible for hours.\n",
            "We survived.\n",
            "But this event put cybersecurity at the very top of agenda,\n",
            "both in terms of strengthening the platform and backing it up.\n",
            "So how do you back up a country-wide system in a small state\n",
            "where everything is super close?\n",
            "Well for instance, you can export a copy of the data\n",
            "outside the country territory\n",
            "to an extraterritorial space of an embassy.\n",
            "Today, we have those data embassies\n",
            "that are holding the most critical digital assets of Estonia,\n",
            "guaranteeing continuity of operations,\n",
            "protection of our data,\n",
            "and most importantly, our sovereignty.\n",
            "Even in case of a physical attack on our territory.\n",
            "Some of you might be thinking by now:\n",
            "Where are the downsides?\n",
            "Well, going all digital\n",
            "is administratively, and let's be honest, financially more efficient.\n",
            "Interfacing primarily with computer systems\n",
            "might create an impression that the human factor,\n",
            "elected politicians\n",
            "and participating in democratic processes\n",
            "is somehow less important.\n",
            "And there are also some people\n",
            "who feel threatened by pervasive technology\n",
            "that might make their skills obsolete.\n",

            "after protons and neutrons formed,\n",
            "after hydrogen formed,\n",

            "The spots in this image\n",

            "starts to separate from it,\n",
            "cool down, form stars,\n",
            "and you get a small galaxy.\n",
            "Over time, over billions and billions of years,\n",
            "those small galaxies crash into each other\n",
            "and merge and grow to become larger galaxies,\n",
            "like our own galaxy, the Milky Way.\n",
            "Now, what happens if you don't have dark matter?\n",
            "If you don't have dark matter,\n",
            "those spots never get clumpy enough.\n",
            "It turns out, you need at least a million times the mass of the Sun\n",
            "in one dense region,\n",
            "before you can start forming stars.\n",
            "And without dark matter,\n",
            "you never get enough stuff in one place.\n",
            "So here, we're looking at two universes, side by side.\n",
            "In one of them you can see\n",
            "that things get clumpy quickly.\n",
            "In that universe,\n",
            "it's really easy to form galaxies.\n",
            "In the other universe,\n",
            "the things that start out like small clumps,\n",
            "they just stay really small.\n",
            "Not very much happens.\n",
            "In that universe, you wouldn't get our galaxy.\n",
            "Or any other galaxy.\n",
            "You wouldn't get the Milky Way,\n",
            "you wouldn't get the Sun,\n",
            "you wouldn't get us.\n",
            "We just couldn't exist in that universe.\n",
            "OK, so this crazy stuff, dark matter,\n",
            "it's most of the mass in the universe,\n",
            "it's going through us right now, we wouldn't be here without it.\n",
            "What is it?\n",
            "Well, we have no idea.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "But we have a lot of educated guesses,\n",
            "and a lot of ideas for how to find out more.\n",
            "So, most physicists think that dark matter is a particle,\n",
            "similar in many ways to the subatomic particles that we know of,\n",
            "like protons and neutrons and electrons.\n",
            "Whatever it is,\n",
            "it behaves very similarly with respect to gravity.\n",
            "But it doesn't emit or absorb light,\n",
            "and it goes right through normal matter,\n",
            "as if it wasn't even there.\n",
            "We'd like to know what particle it is.\n",
            "For example, how heavy is it?\n",
            "Or, does anything at all happen if it interacts with normal matter?\n",
            "Physicists have lots of great ideas for what it could be,\n",
            "they're very creative.\n",
            "But it's really hard,\n",
            "because those ideas span a huge range.\n",
            "It could be as small as the smallest subatomic particles,\n",
            "or it could be as large as the mass of 100 Suns.\n",
            "So, how do we figure out what it is?\n",
            "Well, physicists and astronomers\n",
            "have a lot of ways to look for dark matter.\n",
            "One of the things we're doing is building sensitive detectors\n",
            "in deep underground mines,\n",
            "waiting for the possibility\n",
            "that a dark matter particle, which goes through us and the Earth,\n",
            "would hit a denser material\n",
            "and leave behind some trace of its passage.\n",
            "We're looking for dark matter in the sky,\n",
            "for the possibility that dark matter particles\n",
            "would crash into each other\n",
            "and create high-energy light that we could see\n",
            "with special gamma-ray telescopes.\n",
            "We're even trying to make dark matter here on Earth,\n",
            "by smashing particles together and looking for what happens,\n",
            "using the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland.\n",
            "Now, so far,\n",
            "all of these experiments have taught us a lot\n",
            "about what dark matter isn't\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "but not yet what it is.\n",
            "There were really good ideas that dark matter could have been,\n",
            "that these experiments would have seen.\n",
            "And they didn't see them yet,\n",
            "so we have to keep looking and thinking harder.\n",
            "Now, another way to get a clue to what dark matter is\n",
            "is to study galaxies.\n",
            "We already talked about\n",
            "how our galaxy and many other galaxies wouldn't even be here\n",
            "without dark matter.\n",
            "Those models also make predictions\n",
            "for many other things about galaxies:\n",
            "How they're distributed in the universe,\n",
            "how they move,\n",
            "how they evolve over time.\n",
            "And we can test those predictions with observations of the sky.\n",
            "So let me just give you two examples\n",
            "of these kinds of measurements we can make with galaxies.\n",
            "The first is that we can make maps of the universe with galaxies.\n",
            "I am part of a survey called the Dark Energy Survey,\n",
            "which has made the largest map of the universe so far.\n",
            "We measured the positions and shapes of 100 million galaxies\n",
            "over one-eighth of the sky.\n",
            "And this map is showing us all the matter in this region of the sky,\n",
            "which is inferred by the light distorted from these 100 million galaxies.\n",
            "The light distorted from all of the matter\n",
            "that was between those galaxies and us.\n",
            "The gravity of the matter is strong enough to bend the path of light.\n",
            "And it gives us this image.\n",
            "So these kinds of maps\n",
            "can tell us about how much dark matter there is,\n",
            "they also tell us where it is\n",
            "and how it changes over time.\n",
            "So we're trying to learn about what the universe is made of\n",
            "on the very largest scales.\n",
            "It turns out that the tiniest galaxies in the universe\n",
            "provide some of the best clues.\n",
            "So why is that?\n",
            "Here are two example simulated universes\n",
            "with two different kinds of dark matter.\n",
            "Both of these pictures are showing you a region\n",
            "around a galaxy like the Milky Way.\n",
            "And you can see that there's a lot of other material around it,\n",
            "little small clumps.\n",
            "Now, in the image on the right,\n",
            "dark matter particles are moving slower than they are in the one on the left.\n",
            "If those dark matter particles are moving really fast,\n",
            "then the gravity in small clumps is not strong enough\n",
            "to slow those fast particles down.\n",
            "And they keep going.\n",
            "They never collapse into these small clumps.\n",
            "So you end up with fewer of them than in the universe on the right.\n",
            "If you don't have those small clumps,\n",
            "then you get fewer small galaxies.\n",
            "If you look up at the southern sky,\n",
            "you can actually see two of these small galaxies,\n",
            "the largest of the small galaxies that are orbiting our Milky Way,\n",
            "the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Small Magellanic Cloud.\n",
            "In the last several years,\n",
            "we have detected a whole bunch more even smaller galaxies.\n",
            "This is an example of one of them\n",
            "that we detected with the same dark energy survey\n",
            "that we used to make maps of the universe.\n",
            "These really small galaxies,\n",
            "some of them are extremely small.\n",
            "Some of them have as few as a few hundred stars,\n",
            "compared to the few hundred billion stars in our Milky Way.\n",
            "So that makes them really hard to find.\n",
            "But in the last decade,\n",
            "we've actually found a whole bunch more of these.\n",
            "We now know of 60 of these tiny galaxies\n",
            "that are orbiting our own Milky Way.\n",
            "And these little guys are a big clue to dark matter.\n",
            "Because just the existence of these galaxies tells us\n",
            "that dark matter can't be moving very fast,\n",
            "and not much can be happening when it runs into normal matter.\n",
            "In the next several years,\n",
            "we're going to make much more precise maps of the sky.\n",
            "And those will help refine our movies\n",
            "of the whole universe and the entire galaxy.\n",
            "Physicists are also making new, more sensitive experiments\n",
            "to try to catch some sign of dark matter in their laboratories.\n",
            "Dark matter is still a huge mystery.\n",
            "But it's a really exciting time to be working on it.\n",
            "We have really clear evidence it exists.\n",

            "But 100 years after Darwin's letter,\n",
            "deep-sea hydrothermal vents, or hot vents, were discovered in the ocean.\n",
            "And these are also chemical factories.\n",

            "The black smoke that you see billowing out of these chimneylike structures\n",
            "is also mineral-rich fluid,\n",
            "which is being fed off by bacteria.\n",
            "And since the discovery of these deep-sea vents,\n",
            "the favored scenario for an origin of life has been in the ocean.\n",
            "And this is for good reason:\n",
            "deep-sea vents are well-known in the ancient rock record,\n",
            "and it's thought that the early Earth had a global ocean\n",

            "So the probability that deep-sea vents were abundant on the very early Earth\n",
            "fits well with an origin of life\n",
            "in the ocean.\n",
            "However ...\n",
            "our research in the Pilbara provides and supports\n",

            "our little rock was geyserite.\n",
            "So this conclusion suggested not only did hot springs exist\n",
            "in our 3.5 billion-year-old volcano in the Pilbara,\n",
            "but it pushed back evidence for life living on land in hot springs\n",

            "it has diversified,\n",

            "At about 2.5 billion years ago,\n",
            "there is evidence that bacteria had begun to produce oxygen,\n",
            "kind of like plants do today.\n",
            "Geologists refer to the period that followed\n",
            "as the Great Oxidation Event.\n",
            "It is implied from rocks called banded iron formations,\n",
            "many of which can be observed as hundreds-of-meter-thick packages of rock\n",

            "The arrival of free oxygen allowed two major changes to occur on our planet.\n",
            "First, it allowed complex life to evolve.\n",
            "You see, life needs oxygen to get big and complex.\n",

            "So in an ironic twist, microbial life made way for complex life,\n",

            "over the planet.\n",
            "Today, we humans dig up fossilized complex life\n",
            "and burn it for fuel.\n",
            "This practice pumps vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,\n",
            "and like our microbial predecessors,\n",

            "And so maybe the reason we aren't connecting with life elsewhere,\n",

            "who's at Knox College in Illinois,\n",
            "and he's been researching this for about 30 years now.\n",
            "And his research suggests several really important things.\n",
            "Firstly, the more you believe\n",
            "you can buy and display your way out of sadness,\n",
            "and into a good life,\n",
            "the more likely you are to become depressed and anxious.\n",
            "And secondly,\n",
            "as a society, we have become much more driven by these beliefs.\n",
            "All throughout my lifetime,\n",
            "under the weight of advertising and Instagram and everything like them.\n",
            "And as I thought about this,\n",
            "I realized it's like we've all been fed since birth, a kind of KFC for the soul.\n",
            "We've been trained to look for happiness in all the wrong places,\n",
            "and just like junk food doesn't meet your nutritional needs\n",
            "and actually makes you feel terrible,\n",
            "junk values don't meet your psychological needs,\n",
            "and they take you away from a good life.\n",
            "But when I first spent time with professor Kasser\n",
            "and I was learning all this,\n",
            "I felt a really weird mixture of emotions.\n",
            "Because on the one hand, I found this really challenging.\n",
            "I could see how often in my own life, when I felt down,\n",
            "I tried to remedy it with some kind of show-offy, grand external solution.\n",
            "And I could see why that did not work well for me.\n",
            "I also thought, isn't this kind of obvious?\n",
            "Isn't this almost like banal, right?\n",
            "If I said to everyone here,\n",
            "none of you are going to lie on your deathbed\n",
            "and think about all the shoes you bought and all the retweets you got,\n",
            "you're going to think about moments\n",
            "of love, meaning and connection in your life.\n",
            "I think that seems almost like a cliché.\n",
            "But I kept talking to professor Kasser and saying,\n",
            "\"Why am I feeling this strange doubleness?\"\n",
            "And he said, \"At some level, we all know these things.\n",

            "I kept asking why, why would we know something so profound,\n",
            "but not live by it?\n",
            "And after a while, professor Kasser said to me,\n",
            "\"Because we live in a machine\n",
            "that is designed to get us to neglect what is important about life.\"\n",
            "I had to really think about that.\n",

            "that is designed to get us to neglect what is important about life.\"\n",

            "He's done loads of research into this;\n",

            "And part of the point of the group\n",
            "was to get people to think about a moment in their life\n",
            "they had actually found meaning and purpose.\n",
            "For different people, it was different things.\n",
            "For some people, it was playing music, writing, helping someone --\n",
            "I'm sure everyone here can picture something, right?\n",
            "And part of the point of the group was to get people to ask,\n",
            "\"OK, how could you dedicate more of your life\n",
            "to pursuing these moments of meaning and purpose,\n",
            "and less to, I don't know, buying crap you don't need,\n",
            "putting it on social media and trying to get people to go,\n",
            "'OMG, so jealous!'\"\n",
            "And what they found was,\n",
            "just having these meetings,\n",
            "it was like a kind of Alcoholics Anonymous for consumerism, right?\n",
            "Getting people to have these meetings, articulate these values,\n",
            "determine to act on them and check in with each other,\n",
            "led to a marked shift in people's values.\n",

            "training us to seek happiness in the wrong places,\n",
            "and towards more meaningful and nourishing values\n",
            "that lift us out of depression.\n",

            "and many I can't talk about here,\n",
            "I kept thinking,\n",
            "you know: Why did it take me so long to see these insights?\n",

            "some of them are more complicated, but not all --\n",
            "when you explain this to people, it's not like rocket science, right?\n",
            "At some level, we already know these things.\n",
            "Why do we find it so hard to understand?\n",
            "I think there's many reasons.\n",
            "But I think one reason is that we have to change our understanding\n",

            "There are very real biological contributions\n",
            "to depression and anxiety.\n",

            "when I moved to Harvard first as a sabbatical,\n",
            "I became interested in another type of network:\n",
            "that time, the networks within ourselves,\n",
            "how the genes and the proteins and the metabolites link to each other\n",
            "and how they connect to disease.\n",

            "in a different area,\n",
            "that is, to understand success.\n",
            "And why did we do that?\n",
            "Well, we thought that, to some degree,\n",
            "our success is determined by the networks we're part of --\n",
            "that our networks can push us forward, they can pull us back.\n",

            "where we develop the networks\n",
            "to really quantify how these things happen.\n",
            "This is a result from that.\n",
            "What you see here is a network of galleries in museums\n",
            "that connect to each other.\n",
            "And through this map that we mapped out last year,\n",
            "we are able to predict very accurately the success of an artist\n",
            "if you give me the first five exhibits that he or she had in their career.\n",
            "Well, as we thought about success,\n",
            "we realized that success is not only about networks;\n",
            "there are so many other dimensions to that.\n",
            "And one of the things we need for success, obviously,\n",
            "is performance.\n",
            "So let's define what's the difference between performance and success.\n",
            "Well, performance is what you do:\n",
            "how fast you run, what kind of paintings you paint,\n",
            "what kind of papers you publish.\n",
            "However, in our working definition,\n",
            "success is about what the community notices from what you did,\n",
            "from your performance:\n",
            "How does it acknowledge it, and how does it reward you for it?\n",
            "In other terms,\n",
            "your performance is about you, but your success is about all of us.\n",
            "And this was a very important shift for us,\n",
            "because the moment we defined success as being a collective measure\n",
            "that the community provides to us,\n",
            "it became measurable,\n",
            "because if it's in the community, there are multiple data points about that.\n",
            "So we go to school, we exercise, we practice,\n",
            "because we believe that performance leads to success.\n",
            "But the way we actually started to explore,\n",
            "we realized that performance and success are very, very different animals\n",
            "when it comes to the mathematics of the problem.\n",
            "And let me illustrate that.\n",
            "So what you see here is the fastest man on earth, Usain Bolt.\n",
            "And of course, he wins most of the competitions that he enters.\n",
            "And we know he's the fastest on earth because we have a chronometer\n",
            "to measure his speed.\n",
            "Well, what is interesting about him is that when he wins,\n",
            "he doesn't do so by really significantly outrunning his competition.\n",
            "He's running at most a percent faster than the one who loses the race.\n",
            "And not only does he run only one percent faster than the second one,\n",
            "but he doesn't run 10 times faster than I do --\n",
            "and I'm not a good runner, trust me on that.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "And every time we are able to measure performance,\n",
            "we notice something very interesting;\n",
            "that is, performance is bounded.\n",
            "What it means is that there are no huge variations in human performance.\n",
            "It varies only in a narrow range,\n",
            "and we do need the chronometer to measure the differences.\n",
            "This is not to say that we cannot see the good from the best ones,\n",
            "but the best ones are very hard to distinguish.\n",
            "And the problem with that is that most of us work in areas\n",
            "where we do not have a chronometer to gauge our performance.\n",
            "Alright, performance is bounded,\n",
            "there are no huge differences between us when it comes to our performance.\n",
            "How about success?\n",
            "Well, let's switch to a different topic, like books.\n",
            "One measure of success for writers is how many people read your work.\n",
            "And so when my previous book came out in 2009,\n",
            "I was in Europe talking with my editor,\n",
            "and I was interested: Who is the competition?\n",

            "That week --\n",

            "Dan Brown came out with \"The Lost Symbol,\"\n",
            "and \"The Last Song\" also came out,\n",
            "Nicholas Sparks.\n",
            "And when you just look at the list,\n",
            "you realize, you know, performance-wise, there's hardly any difference\n",
            "between these books or mine.\n",
            "Right?\n",
            "So maybe if Nicholas Sparks's team works a little harder,\n",
            "he could easily be number one,\n",
            "because it's almost by accident who ended up at the top.\n",
            "So I said, let's look at the numbers -- I'm a data person, right?\n",
            "So let's see what were the sales for Nicholas Sparks.\n",
            "And it turns out that that opening weekend,\n",
            "Nicholas Sparks sold more than a hundred thousand copies,\n",
            "which is an amazing number.\n",
            "You can actually get to the top of the \"New York Times\" best-seller list\n",
            "by selling 10,000 copies a week,\n",
            "so he tenfold overcame what he needed to be number one.\n",
            "Yet he wasn't number one.\n",
            "Why?\n",
            "Because there was Dan Brown, who sold 1.2 million copies that weekend.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "And the reason I like this number is because it shows that, really,\n",
            "when it comes to success, it's unbounded,\n",
            "that the best doesn't only get slightly more than the second best\n",
            "but gets orders of magnitude more,\n",
            "because success is a collective measure.\n",
            "We give it to them, rather than we earn it through our performance.\n",
            "So one of things we realized is that performance, what we do, is bounded,\n",
            "but success, which is collective, is unbounded,\n",
            "which makes you wonder:\n",
            "How do you get these huge differences in success\n",
            "when you have such tiny differences in performance?\n",
            "And recently, I published a book that I devoted to that very question.\n",

            "alright, you have success; when should that appear?\n",
            "So let's go back to the party spoiler and ask ourselves:\n",
            "Why did Einstein make this ridiculous statement,\n",
            "that only before 30 you could actually be creative?\n",
            "Well, because he looked around himself and he saw all these fabulous physicists\n",

            "and they were all in their 20s and early 30s when they did so.\n",
            "And it's not only him.\n",
            "It's not only observational bias,\n",
            "because there's actually a whole field of genius research\n",
            "that has documented the fact that,\n",
            "if we look at the people we admire from the past\n",
            "and then look at what age they made their biggest contribution,\n",
            "whether that's music, whether that's science,\n",
            "whether that's engineering,\n",
            "most of them tend to do so in their 20s, 30s, early 40s at most.\n",
            "But there's a problem with this genius research.\n",
            "Well, first of all, it created the impression to us\n",

            "which is painful, right?\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "And it also has an observational bias,\n",
            "because it only looks at geniuses and doesn't look at ordinary scientists\n",
            "and doesn't look at all of us and ask,\n",
            "is it really true that creativity vanishes as we age?\n",
            "So that's exactly what we tried to do,\n",
            "and this is important for that to actually have references.\n",
            "So let's look at an ordinary scientist like myself,\n",
            "and let's look at my career.\n",
            "So what you see here is all the papers that I've published\n",
            "from my very first paper, in 1989; I was still in Romania when I did so,\n",
            "till kind of this year.\n",
            "And vertically, you see the impact of the paper,\n",
            "that is, how many citations,\n",
            "how many other papers have been written that cited that work.\n",
            "And when you look at that,\n",
            "you see that my career has roughly three different stages.\n",
            "I had the first 10 years where I had to work a lot\n",
            "and I don't achieve much.\n",
            "No one seems to care about what I do, right?\n",
            "There's hardly any impact.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "That time, I was doing material science,\n",
            "and then I kind of discovered for myself networks\n",
            "and then started publishing in networks.\n",
            "And that led from one high-impact paper to the other one.\n",
            "And it really felt good. That was that stage of my career.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "So the question is, what happens right now?\n",
            "And we don't know, because there hasn't been enough time passed yet\n",
            "to actually figure out how much impact those papers will get;\n",
            "it takes time to acquire.\n",
            "Well, when you look at the data,\n",
            "it seems to be that Einstein, the genius research, is right,\n",
            "and I'm at that stage of my career.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "So we said, OK, let's figure out how does this really happen,\n",
            "first in science.\n",
            "And in order not to have the selection bias,\n",
            "to look only at geniuses,\n",
            "we ended up reconstructing the career of every single scientist\n",
            "from 1900 till today\n",
            "and finding for all scientists what was their personal best,\n",
            "whether they got the Nobel Prize or they never did,\n",
            "or no one knows what they did, even their personal best.\n",
            "And that's what you see in this slide.\n",
            "Each line is a career,\n",
            "and when you have a light blue dot on the top of that career,\n",
            "it says that was their personal best.\n",
            "And the question is,\n",
            "when did they actually make their biggest discovery?\n",
            "To quantify that,\n",
            "we look at what's the probability that you make your biggest discovery,\n",
            "let's say, one, two, three or 10 years into your career?\n",
            "We're not looking at real age.\n",
            "We're looking at what we call \"academic age.\"\n",
            "Your academic age starts when you publish your first papers.\n",
            "I know some of you are still babies.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "So let's look at the probability\n",
            "that you publish your highest-impact paper.\n",
            "And what you see is, indeed, the genius research is right.\n",
            "Most scientists tend to publish their highest-impact paper\n",
            "in the first 10, 15 years in their career,\n",
            "and it tanks after that.\n",
            "It tanks so fast that I'm about -- I'm exactly 30 years into my career,\n",
            "and the chance that I will publish a paper that would have a higher impact\n",
            "than anything that I did before\n",
            "is less than one percent.\n",
            "I am in that stage of my career, according to this data.\n",
            "But there's a problem with that.\n",
            "We're not doing controls properly.\n",
            "So the control would be,\n",
            "what would a scientist look like who makes random contribution to science?\n",
            "Or what is the productivity of the scientist?\n",
            "When do they write papers?\n",
            "So we measured the productivity,\n",
            "and amazingly, the productivity,\n",
            "your likelihood of writing a paper in year one, 10 or 20 in your career,\n",
            "is indistinguishable from the likelihood of having the impact\n",
            "in that part of your career.\n",
            "And to make a long story short,\n",
            "after lots of statistical tests, there's only one explanation for that,\n",
            "that really, the way we scientists work\n",
            "is that every single paper we write, every project we do,\n",
            "has exactly the same chance of being our personal best.\n",
            "That is, discovery is like a lottery ticket.\n",
            "And the more lottery tickets we buy,\n",
            "the higher our chances.\n",
            "And it happens to be so\n",
            "that most scientists buy most of their lottery tickets\n",
            "in the first 10, 15 years of their career,\n",
            "and after that, their productivity decreases.\n",
            "They're not buying any more lottery tickets.\n",
            "So it looks as if they would not be creative.\n",
            "In reality, they stopped trying.\n",
            "So when we actually put the data together, the conclusion is very simple:\n",
            "success can come at any time.\n",
            "It could be your very first or very last paper of your career.\n",
            "It's totally random in the space of the projects.\n",
            "It is the productivity that changes.\n",
            "Let me illustrate that.\n",
            "Here is Frank Wilczek, who got the Nobel Prize in Physics\n",
            "for the very first paper he ever wrote in his career as a graduate student.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "More interesting is John Fenn,\n",
            "who, at age 70, was forcefully retired by Yale University.\n",
            "They shut his lab down,\n",
            "and at that moment, he moved to Virginia Commonwealth University,\n",
            "opened another lab,\n",
            "and it is there, at age 72, that he published a paper\n",
            "for which, 15 years later, he got the Nobel Prize for Chemistry.\n",
            "And you think, OK, well, science is special,\n",
            "but what about other areas where we need to be creative?\n",
            "So let me take another typical example: entrepreneurship.\n",
            "Silicon Valley,\n",
            "the land of the youth, right?\n",
            "And indeed, when you look at it,\n",
            "you realize that the biggest awards, the TechCrunch Awards and other awards,\n",
            "are all going to people\n",
            "whose average age is late 20s, very early 30s.\n",
            "You look at who the VCs give the money to, some of the biggest VC firms --\n",
            "all people in their early 30s.\n",
            "Which, of course, we know;\n",
            "there is this ethos in Silicon Valley that youth equals success.\n",
            "Not when you look at the data,\n",
            "because it's not only about forming a company --\n",
            "forming a company is like productivity, trying, trying, trying --\n",
            "when you look at which of these individuals actually put out\n",
            "a successful company, a successful exit.\n",
            "And recently, some of our colleagues looked at exactly that question.\n",
            "And it turns out that yes, those in the 20s and 30s\n",
            "put out a huge number of companies, form lots of companies,\n",
            "but most of them go bust.\n",
            "And when you look at the successful exits, what you see in this particular plot,\n",
            "the older you are, the more likely that you will actually hit the stock market\n",
            "or the sell the company successfully.\n",
            "This is so strong, actually, that if you are in the 50s,\n",
            "you are twice as likely to actually have a successful exit\n",
            "than if you are in your 30s.\n",
            "(Applause)\n",
            "So in the end, what is it that we see, actually?\n",
            "What we see is that creativity has no age.\n",
            "Productivity does, right?\n",
            "Which is telling me that at the end of the day,\n",
            "if you keep trying --\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "you could still succeed and succeed over and over.\n",
            "So my conclusion is very simple:\n",
            "I am off the stage, back in my lab.\n",
            "Thank you.\n",
            "(Applause)\n"

            "Alright, so look, it's a great question if you are pretending to be psychic,\n",
            "because it's about the future,\n",
            "which means I can give you a yes or no on this.\n",
            "It means nothing. You have no way of verifying it.\n",
            "And a dangerous thing to do --\n",
            "and if I say yes or no, it'll just stick in the back of your mind,\n",
            "and it can't not start to affect decisions you make.\n",
            "So a dangerous thing to do. However --\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Yes, I think you will sell the farm,\n",
            "because I think you're the sort of person\n",

            "and they're a little more effective and they do more than that.\n",
            "So the new generation of robogamis actually serve a purpose.\n",
            "For example, this one actually navigates through different terrains autonomously.\n",
            "So when it's a dry and flat land, it crawls.\n",
            "And if it meets sudden rough terrain,\n",
            "it starts rolling.\n",
            "It does this -- it's the same robot --\n",
            "but depending on which terrain it meets,\n",
            "it activates a different sequence of actuators that's on board.\n",
            "And once it meets an obstacle, it jumps over it.\n",

            "So with a manipulator, it can pick up an object.\n",
            "Of course, you can add more modules to make the manipulator legs longer\n",
            "to attack or pick up objects that are bigger or smaller,\n",
            "or even have a third arm.\n",
            "For robogamis, there's no one fixed shape nor task.\n",
            "They can transform into anything, anywhere, anytime.\n",
            "So how do you make them?\n",
            "The biggest technical challenge of robogami is keeping them super thin,\n",
            "flexible,\n",
            "but still remaining functional.\n",

            "Scientists all over the world\n",
            "have been focusing on making solar panels more efficient and cheaper.\n",
            "So the price of solar has dropped enormously.\n",

            "to power its indoor climate.\n",
            "We use hydroponics that pumps around nutrified water,\n",

            "By stacking up in layers, you are able to grow more yield per square meter.\n",
            "Extra light, besides sunlight, coming from these colored LED lights\n",

            "you don't have to fly it in from the other side of the world,\n",
            "you are able to grow it on the location itself.\n",
            "Well, the big dream is to build these in off-grid places --\n",
            "where there's no access to water, electricity --\n",
            "as an independent ecosystem.\n",
            "For this year's Design Biennial,\n",
            "I created the first four-meter high model of the power plant,\n",
            "so you could come in and experience how plants grow.\n",

            "It's like a future botanical garden,\n",
            "where we celebrate all these modern technologies.\n",
            "And the biggest compliment I got was, \"But where are the solar panels?\"\n",

            "When I compare this to groups like the australopithecines,\n",
            "the intraspecific variation is much larger.\n",
            "Postcranially, the team concluded\n",
            "that the position of the shoulders suggesting naledi was a climber;\n",
            "the flared pelvis and curved fingers are all primitive for the genus Homo.\n",
            "On the other hand,\n",
            "the humanlike wrist, long slender legs and modern feet\n",

            "In addition, our geology team managed to produce an age estimate.\n",
            "The date's a big deal because, up until now,\n",
            "we had based our analysis solely on the morphology of the specimens,\n",
            "without previous knowledge of how old something is --\n",
            "something which could unconsciously bias our interpretations.\n",
            "With its small brain and flared pelvis,\n",
            "we would not have been surprised\n",
            "if the fossils turned out to be two million years old.\n",
            "Instead, the fossils dated\n",
            "to 235 to 336 thousand years,\n",
            "an incredibly young date for such a small-brained individual.\n",

            "Homo naledi has taught us\n",
            "that we need to reassess what it means to be in the genus Homo.\n",
            "We need to rethink what it means to be human.\n",
            "In fact, most of the characteristics that we use to define the genus Homo,\n",
            "such as brain size and hip morphology,\n",

            "No other species exists with this mix of primitive and derived traits.\n",

            "And what force is driving that variation?\n",
            "Another implication for these fossils is that for the first time,\n",
            "we have concrete evidence of a species coexisting in Africa,\n",
            "at 300,000 years,\n",
            "with modern humans.\n",
            "Until this discovery,\n",
            "we only had large-brained modern humans that existed in Africa.\n",
            "Did they interbreed with each other?\n",
            "Did they compete with each other?\n",
            "Another implication that these fossils have\n",
            "is for the archaeologists studying stone tools in South Africa.\n",
            "Keep in mind that neither the Dinaledi nor the Lesedi Chambers\n",
            "have any artifacts in them.\n",
            "However, they do overlap in time with several stone-tool industries,\n",
            "the makers of which are considered to be either modern humans\n",
            "or direct human ancestors.\n",
            "This begs the question:\n",
            "Who made the stone tools of South Africa?\n",
            "Brain size has historically played a key role\n",
            "in identifying a species as a tool user.\n",
            "The idea is that you need to have a large brain\n",
            "to have even the capacity to make stone tools.\n",
            "But that notion has been questioned.\n",
            "Furthermore, Homo naledi, even with its small brain size,\n",
            "has a hand-wrist morphology similar to other species\n",
            "that did make and use stone tools,\n",
            "suggesting it had the capability.\n",
            "With two species coexisting in Africa at 300,000 years,\n",
            "we can no longer assume we know the maker of tools\n",
            "at sites with no associated species.\n",
            "So where does Homo naledi fit in our human evolutionary lineage?\n",
            "Who is it most closely related to?\n",
            "Who did it evolve from?\n",
            "We're still trying to figure all that out.\n",

            "for having small sample sizes.\n",

            "So, I'm a climate scientist,\n",
            "and if this room is representative of the country we live in,\n",
            "that means about 60 percent of you, so maybe from about there over,\n",
            "don't strongly trust me for information on the causes of climate change.\n",
            "Now, I promise to tell the truth tonight,\n",
            "but just to humor that demographic,\n",
            "I've started this talk with a falsehood.\n",
            "[The Paris Climate Accord is a product of the recognition\n",
            "that climate change is a global problem ...]\n",
            "This statement was not made by President Obama.\n",
            "It was made by President Reagan,\n",
            "and it wasn't about climate change and the Paris Climate Accord.\n",
            "It was actually about the Montreal Protocol\n",
            "and stratospheric ozone depletion.\n",
            "Now, I'm sure that many of you aren't familiar with this environmental problem,\n",
            "but you should be,\n",
            "because it's a rare environmental success story.\n",
            "And it's worth revisiting,\n",
            "because sometimes, we need to examine the world we've avoided\n",
            "in order to find guidance for the choices we make today.\n",
            "So let's go back to the 1970s,\n",
            "when some questionable choices were made:\n",
            "first of all -- hoo -- hairstyles. (Laughs)\n",
            "Second of all, objectively terrible quantities of hairspray,\n",
            "and third, CFCs, chlorofluorocarbons,\n",
            "man-made chemicals that were used as propellant in aerosol spray cans.\n",
            "And see, it turns out these CFCs were a problem\n",
            "because they were destroying the ozone layer.\n",
            "Now I'm sure most of you have heard of the ozone layer,\n",
            "but why does it matter?\n",
            "Well, quite simply, the ozone layer is earth's sunscreen,\n",
            "and it's really fragile.\n",
            "If you could take all of the ozone,\n",
            "which is mostly about 10 to 20 miles up above our heads,\n",
            "and compress it down to the surface of the earth,\n",
            "it would form a thin shell only about two pennies thick,\n",
            "about an eighth of an inch.\n",
            "And that thin shell does an amazing amount of work, though.\n",
            "It filters out more than 90 percent of the harmful UV radiation\n",
            "coming from the sun.\n",
            "And while I'm sure many of you enjoy that suntan that you get\n",
            "from the remaining 10 percent, it causes a lot of problems:\n",
            "cataracts,\n",
            "damage to crops,\n",
            "damage to immune systems\n",
            "and also skin cancer.\n",
            "It's not an exaggeration\n",
            "to say that a threat to the ozone layer is a threat to human safety.\n",
            "And actually, ironically, it was human safety\n",
            "that motivated the invention of CFCs in the first place.\n",
            "You see, in the early days of refrigeration,\n",
            "refrigerators used toxic and flammable chemicals\n",
            "like propane and ammonia.\n",
            "For good reason, the refrigeration industry\n",
            "wanted a safe alternative,\n",
            "and they found that in 1928,\n",
            "when a scientist named Thomas Midgley\n",
            "synthesized the first commercially viable CFCs.\n",
            "And in fact, Midgley famously inhaled CFCs and blew out a candle\n",
            "to demonstrate, at a scientific conference,\n",
            "that they were safe and nonflammable.\n",
            "And in fact, as a scientist, I can tell you there is no way\n",
            "you could get away with that kind of antic today.\n",
            "I mean, wow.\n",
            "But really, at the time,\n",
            "CFCs were a really remarkable invention.\n",
            "They allowed what we now know as modern-day refrigeration\n",
            "and air-conditioning and other things.\n",
            "So it wasn't actually until over 40 years later, in the 1970s,\n",
            "when scientists realized that CFCs would break down high in the atmosphere\n",
            "and damage the ozone layer.\n",
            "And this finding really set off a lot of public concern.\n",
            "It led, ultimately, to the banning of CFC usage in aerosol spray cans\n",
            "in the US and a few other countries in 1978.\n",
            "Now, the story doesn't end there,\n",
            "because CFCs were used in much more than just spray cans.\n",
            "In 1985, scientists discovered the Antarctic ozone hole,\n",
            "and this was a truly alarming discovery.\n",
            "Scientists did not expect this at all.\n",
            "Before the Antarctic ozone hole,\n",
            "scientists expected maybe a five or 10 percent reduction\n",
            "in ozone over a century.\n",
            "But what they found over the course of less than a decade\n",
            "was that more than a third of the ozone had simply vanished,\n",
            "over an area larger than the size of the US.\n",
            "And although we now know that CFCs are the root cause of this ozone hole,\n",
            "at the time, the science was far from settled.\n",
            "Yet despite this uncertainty,\n",
            "the crisis helped spur nations to act.\n",
            "So that quote that I started this talk with,\n",
            "about the Montreal Protocol, from President Reagan --\n",
            "that was his signing statement when he signed the Montreal Protocol\n",
            "after its unanimous ratification by the US Senate.\n",
            "And this is something that's truly worth celebrating.\n",
            "In fact, yesterday was the 30th anniversary of the Montreal Protocol.\n",
            "(Applause)\n",
            "Because of the protocol,\n",
            "ozone-depleting substances are now declining in our atmosphere,\n",
            "and we're starting to see the first signs of healing in the ozone layer.\n",
            "And furthermore, because many of those ozone-depleting substances\n",
            "are also very potent greenhouse gases,\n",
            "the Montreal Protocol has actually delayed global warming\n",
            "by more than a decade.\n",
            "That's just wonderful.\n",
            "But I think it's worth asking the question,\n",
            "as we face our current environmental crisis, global warming,\n",
            "what lessons can we learn from Montreal?\n",
            "Are there any? I think there are.\n",
            "First, we don't need absolute certainty to act.\n",
            "When Montreal was signed,\n",
            "we were less certain then of the risks from CFCs\n",
            "than we are now of the risks from greenhouse gas emissions.\n",
            "A common tactic that people who oppose climate action use\n",
            "is to completely ignore risk and focus only on uncertainty.\n",
            "But so what about uncertainty?\n",
            "We make decisions in the face of uncertainty all the time,\n",
            "literally all the time.\n",
            "You know, I'll bet those of you who drove here tonight,\n",
            "you probably wore your seat belt.\n",
            "And so ask yourself,\n",
            "did you wear your seat belt because someone told you\n",
            "with a hundred percent [certainty]\n",
            "that you would get in a car crash on the way here?\n",
            "Probably not.\n",
            "So that's the first lesson.\n",
            "Risk management and decision making always have uncertainty.\n",
            "Ignoring risk and focusing only on uncertainty is a distraction.\n",
            "In other words, inaction is an action.\n",
            "Second, it takes a village to raise a healthy environment.\n",
            "The Montreal Protocol wasn't just put together by industry and governments\n",
            "or environmental advocacy groups and scientists.\n",
            "It was put together by all of them.\n",
            "They all had a seat at the table,\n",
            "and they all played an important role in the solution.\n",
            "And I think in this regard,\n",
            "we're actually seeing some encouraging signs today.\n",
            "We see not just environmental groups concerned about climate change\n",
            "but also civic and religious groups,\n",
            "the military and businesses.\n",
            "So wherever you find yourself on that spectrum,\n",
            "we need you at the table,\n",
            "because if we're going to solve global warming,\n",
            "it's going to take actions at all levels,\n",
            "from the individual to the international\n",
            "and everything in between.\n",
            "Third lesson:\n",
            "don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\n",
            "While Montreal has become the brake pedal for stopping ozone depletion,\n",
            "at its beginning, it was more just like a tap on the brakes.\n",
            "It was actually the later amendments to the protocol\n",
            "that really marked the decision to hit the brakes on ozone depletion.\n",
            "So to those who despair\n",
            "that the Paris Climate Accord didn't go far enough\n",
            "or that your limited actions on their own won't solve global warming,\n",
            "I say don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\n",
            "And finally, I think it helps us to contemplate the world we've avoided.\n",
            "Indeed, the world we have avoided by enacting the Montreal Protocol\n",
            "is one of catastrophic changes\n",
            "to our environment and to human well-being.\n",
            "By the 2030s, we'll be avoiding millions of new skin cancer cases per year\n",
            "with a number that would only grow.\n",
            "If I'm lucky, I'll live long enough to see the end of this animation\n",
            "and to see the ozone hole restored to its natural state.\n",
            "So as we write the story for earth's climate future\n",
            "for this century and beyond,\n",
            "we need to ask ourselves, what will our actions be\n",
            "so that someone can stand on this stage\n",
            "in 30 or 50 or a hundred years\n",
            "to celebrate the world that they've avoided.\n",
            "Thank you.\n",
            "(Applause)\n"

            "Your savings behavior isn't a question of how smart you are\n",
            "or how much willpower you have.\n",
            "The amount we save depends on the environmental cues around us.\n",
            "Let me give you an example.\n",
            "We ran a study in which, in one group,\n",
            "we showed people their income on a monthly basis.\n",
            "In another group, we showed people their income on a weekly basis.\n",
            "And what we found was that people who saw their income on a weekly basis\n",
            "were able to budget better throughout the month.\n",
            "Now, it's important to know\n",
            "that we didn't change how much money people were receiving,\n",
            "we just changed the environment in which they understood their income.\n",
            "And environmental cues like this have an impact.\n",
            "So I'm not going to share tricks with you that you already know.\n",
            "I'm not going to tell you how to open up a savings account\n",
            "or how to start saving for your retirement.\n",
            "What I am going to share with you is how to bridge this gap\n",
            "from your intentions to save\n",
            "and your actions.\n",
            "Are you ready?\n",
            "Here's number one:\n",
            "harness the power of pre-commitment.\n",
            "Fundamentally, we think about ourselves in two different ways:\n",
            "our present self and our future self.\n",
            "In the future, we're perfect.\n",
            "In the future, we're going to save for retirement,\n",
            "we're going to lose weight,\n",
            "we're going to call our parents more.\n",
            "But we oftentimes forget that our future self\n",
            "is exactly the same person as our present self.\n",
            "We know that one of the best times to save is when you get your tax return.\n",
            "So we tried an A/B test.\n",
            "In the first group, we texted people in early February,\n",
            "hopefully before they even filed for their taxes.\n",
            "And we asked them,\n",
            "\"If you get a tax refund, what percentage would you like to save?\"\n",
            "Now this is a really hard question.\n",
            "They didn't know if they would receive a tax refund or how much.\n",
            "But we asked the question anyway.\n",
            "In the second group, we asked people right after they received their refund,\n",
            "\"What percentage would you like to save?\"\n",
            "Now, here's what happened.\n",
            "In that second condition, when people just received their tax refund,\n",
            "they wanted to save about 17 percent of their tax refund.\n",
            "But in the condition when we asked people before they even filed their taxes,\n",
            "savings rates increased from 17 percent to 27 percent\n",
            "when we asked in February.\n",
            "Why?\n",
            "Because you're committing for your future self,\n",
            "and of course your future self can save 27 percent.\n",
            "These large changes in savings behavior\n",
            "came from the fact that we changed the decision-making environment.\n",
            "We want you to be able to harness that same power.\n",
            "So take a moment\n",
            "and think about the ways in which you can sign up your future self\n",
            "for something that you know today will be a little bit hard.\n",
            "Sign up for an app that lets you make savings decisions in advance.\n",
            "The trick is, you have to have that binding contract.\n",
            "Number two: use transition moments to your advantage.\n",
            "We did an experiment with a website\n",
            "that helps older adults share their housing.\n",
            "We ran two ads on social media,\n",
            "targeted to the same population of 64-year-olds.\n",
            "In one group, we said, \"Hey, you're getting older.\n",
            "Are you ready for retirement?\n",
            "House sharing can help.\"\n",
            "In the second group, we got a little bit more specific\n",
            "and said, \"You're 64 turning 65.\n",
            "Are you ready for retirement?\n",
            "House sharing can help.\"\n",
            "What we're doing in that second group\n",
            "is highlighting that a transition is happening.\n",
            "All of a sudden,\n",
            "we saw click-through rates, and ultimately sign-up rates, increase\n",
            "when we highlight that.\n",
            "In psychology, we call this the \"fresh start effect.\"\n",
            "Whether it's the start of a new year or even a new season,\n",
            "your motivation to act increases.\n",
            "So right now, put a meeting request on your calendar\n",
            "for the day before your next birthday.\n",
            "Identify the one financial thing you most want to do.\n",
            "And commit yourself to it.\n",
            "The third and final trick:\n",
            "get a handle on small, frequent purchases.\n",
            "We've run a few different studies\n",
            "and found that the number one purchase people say they regret, after bank fees,\n",
            "is eating out.\n",
            "It's a frequent purchase we make almost every day,\n",
            "and it's death by a thousand cuts.\n",
            "A coffee here, a burrito there ...\n",
            "It adds up and decreases our ability to save.\n",
            "Back when I lived in New York City,\n",
            "I looked at my expenses\n",
            "and saw that I spent over 2,000 dollars on ride-sharing apps.\n",
            "It was more than my New York City rent.\n",
            "I vowed to make a change.\n",
            "And the next month, I spent 2,000 dollars again --\n",
            "no change, because the information alone didn't change my behavior.\n",
            "I didn't change my environment.\n",
            "So now that I was 4,000 dollars in the hole, I did two things.\n",
            "The first is that I unlinked my credit card\n",
            "from my car-sharing apps.\n",
            "Instead, I linked a debit card that only had 300 dollars a month.\n",
            "If I needed more,\n",
            "I had to go through the whole process of adding a new card,\n",
            "and we know that every click, every barrier, changes our behavior.\n",

            "But the question is:\n",
            "What change do I want to see?\n",
            "And I know that the questions I have to ask myself are:\n",
            "One, am I honest about the scope of my ambition?\n",
            "Because it's easy to figure out that once you didn't get what you wanted,\n",
            "then maybe you should have set your sights a little lower,\n",
            "but I'm here to tell you to be aggressive about your ambition.\n",
            "Do not allow setbacks to set you back.\n",

            "Number two, let yourself understand your mistakes.\n",
            "But also understand their mistakes,\n",
            "because, as women in particular,\n",
            "we're taught that if something doesn't work out,\n",
            "it's probably our fault.\n",
            "And usually, there is something we could do better,\n",
            "but we've been told not to investigate too much\n",
            "what the other side could have done.\n",
            "And this isn't partisan -- it's people.\n",
            "We're too often told that our mistakes are ours alone,\n",
            "but victory is a shared benefit.\n",
            "And so what I tell you to do is understand your mistakes,\n",
            "but understand the mistakes of others.\n",
            "And be clearheaded about it.\n",
            "And be honest with yourself and honest with those who support you.\n",
            "But once you know what you want,\n",
            "understand why you want it.\n",
            "And even though it feels good, revenge is not a good reason.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Instead, make sure you want it\n",
            "because there's something not that you should do,\n",
            "but something you must do.\n",
            "It has to be something that doesn't allow you to sleep at night\n",
            "unless you're dreaming about it;\n",
            "something that wakes you up in the morning and gets you excited about it;\n",
            "or something that makes you so angry,\n",
            "you know you have to do something about it.\n",
            "But know why you're doing it.\n",
            "And know why it must be done.\n",
            "You've listened to women from across this world\n",
            "talk about why things have to happen.\n",
            "But figure out what the \"why\" is for you,\n",
            "because jumping from the \"what\" to the \"do\"\n",
            "is meaningless if you don't know why.\n",
            "Because when it gets hard, when it gets tough,\n",
            "when your friends walk away from you,\n",
            "when your supporters forget you,\n",
            "when you don't win your first race --\n",
            "if you don't know why, you can't try again.\n",
            "So, first know what you want.\n",
            "Second, know why you want it,\n",
            "but third, know how you're going to get it done.\n",
            "I faced a few obstacles in this race.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Just a few.\n",
            "But in the pursuit,\n",
            "I became the first black woman to ever become the nominee for governor\n",
            "in the history of the United States of America for a major party.\n",
            "(Cheers)\n",
            "(Applause)\n",
            "But more importantly, in this process,\n",
            "we turned out 1.2 million African American voters in Georgia.\n",
            "That is more voters\n",
            "than voted on the Democratic side of the ticket in 2014.\n",
            "(Applause)\n",
            "Our campaign tripled the number of Latinos\n",
            "who believed their voices mattered in the state of Georgia.\n",
            "We tripled the number of Asian Americans\n",
            "who stood up and said, \"This is our state, too.\"\n",
            "Those are successes that tell me how I can get it done.\n",
            "But they also let me understand the obstacles aren't insurmountable.\n",
            "They're just a little high.\n",
            "But I also understand\n",
            "that there are three things that always hold us hostage.\n",
            "The first is finances.\n",
            "Now, you may have heard, I'm in a little bit of debt.\n",
            "If you didn't hear about it, you did not go outside.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "And finances are something that holds us back so often,\n",
            "our dreams are bounded by how much we have in resources.\n",
            "But we hear again and again\n",
            "the stories of those who overcome those resource challenges.\n",
            "But you can't overcome something you don't talk about.\n",
            "And that's why I didn't allow them to debt-shame me in my campaign.\n",
            "I didn't allow anyone to tell me that my lack of opportunity\n",
            "was a reason to disqualify me from running.\n",
            "And believe me, people tried to tell me I shouldn't run.\n",
            "Friends told me not to run.\n",
            "Allies told me not to run.\n",
            "\"USA Today\" mentioned maybe I shouldn't run.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "But no matter who it was,\n",
            "I understood that finances are often a reason we don't let ourselves dream.\n",
            "I can't say that you will always overcome those obstacles,\n",
            "but I will tell you, you will be damned if you do not try.\n",
            "(Applause)\n",
            "The second is fear.\n",
            "And fear is real.\n",
            "It is paralyzing.\n",
            "It is terrifying.\n",
            "But it can also be energizing,\n",
            "because once you know what you're afraid of,\n",
            "you can figure out how to get around it.\n",
            "And the third is fatigue.\n",
            "Sometimes you just get tired of trying.\n",
            "You get tired of reading about processes and politics\n",
            "and the things that stop you from getting where you want to be.\n",
            "Sometimes, fatigue means that we accept position instead of power.\n",
            "We let someone give us a title as a consolation prize,\n",
            "rather than realizing we know what we want and we're going to get it,\n",
            "even if we're tired.\n",
            "That's why God created naps.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "But we also learn in those moments\n",
            "that fatigue is an opportunity to evaluate how much we want it.\n",
            "Because if you are beaten down,\n",
            "if you have worked as hard as you can,\n",
            "if you have done everything you said you should,\n",
            "and it still doesn't work out,\n",
            "fatigue can sap you of your energy.\n",
            "But that's why you go back to the \"why\" of it.\n",
            "Because I know we have to have women who speak for the voiceless.\n",
            "I know we have to have people of good conscience\n",
            "who stand up against oppression.\n",
            "I know we have to have people\n",
            "who understand that social justice belongs to us all.\n",
            "And that wakes me up every morning,\n",
            "and that makes me fight even harder.\n",
            "Because I am moving forward, knowing what is in my past.\n",
            "I know the obstacles they have for me.\n",
            "I know what they're going to do,\n",
            "and I'm fairly certain they're energizing and creating new obstacles now.\n",
            "But they've got four years to figure it out.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "(Applause)\n",
            "Maybe two.\n",
            "(Cheers)\n",
            "(Applause)\n",
            "But here's my point:\n",
            "I know what I want, and that is justice.\n",
            "I know why I want it,\n",
            "because poverty is immoral, and it is a stain on our nation.\n",
            "And I know how I'm going to get it:\n",
            "by moving forward every single day.\n",
            "Thank you so much.\n",

            "(Applause)\n",
            "When I first started working on this problem,\n",
            "I collaborated with a power company\n",
            "to recruit customers for a program that prevents blackouts\n",
            "by reducing energy demand during peaks.\n",

            "People need to sign up.\n",

            "told them about all the program's benefits,\n",
            "and it asked them to call into a hotline if they were interested.\n",
            "Those letters went out,\n",
            "but the phones, they were silent.\n",
            "So when we got involved, we suggested one small change.\n",
            "Instead of that hotline,\n",
            "we suggested that they use sign-up sheets that they'd post near the mailboxes\n",
            "in people's buildings.\n",
            "This tripled participation.\n",
            "Why?\n",
            "Well, we all know people care deeply about what others think of them,\n",
            "that we try to be seen as generous and kind,\n",
            "and we try to avoid being seen as selfish or a mooch.\n",
            "Whether we are aware of it or not, this is a big part of why people do good,\n",
            "and so small changes that give people more credit for doing good,\n",
            "those changes can make a really big difference.\n",
            "Small changes like switching from a hotline,\n",
            "where nobody will ever find out about your good deed,\n",

            "where anyone who walks by can see your name.\n",

            "And in fact, you already know the first item on that checklist.\n",
            "It's to increase observability,\n",
            "to make sure people find out about good deeds.\n",
            "Now, wait a minute, I know some of you are probably thinking,\n",

            "Rather, when they're making decisions in private,\n",
            "they worry about their own problems,\n",
            "about what to put on the table for dinner or how to pay their bills on time.\n",
            "But, when we make their decision more observable,\n",
            "they start to attend more to the opportunity to do good.\n",
            "In other words, what's so powerful about our approach\n",
            "is that it could turn on people's existing desire to do good,\n",
            "in this case, to help to prevent a blackout.\n",
            "Back to observability.\n",
            "I want to give you another example.\n",
            "This one is from a collaboration\n",
            "with a nonprofit that gets out the vote,\n",
            "and it does this by sending hundreds of thousands of letters every election\n",
            "in order to remind people and try to motivate them to go to the polls.\n",
            "We suggested adding the following sentence:\n",
            "\"Someone may call you to find out about your experience at the polls.\"\n",
            "This sentence makes it feel more observable when you go to the polls,\n",
            "and it increased the effect of the letter by 50 percent.\n",
            "Making the letter more effective reduced the cost of getting an additional vote\n",
            "from 70 dollars down to about 40 dollars.\n",
            "Observability has been used to do things\n",
            "like get people to donate blood more frequently\n",
            "by listing the names of donors on local newsletters,\n",
            "or to pay their taxes on time\n",
            "by listing the names of delinquents on a public website.\n",

            "by making the Prius so unique ...\n",

            "that their good deed was observable from a mile away.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Alright, so observability is great,\n",

            "In the case of the Salvation Army,\n",
            "eliminating excuses just means standing in front of both doors,\n",
            "and sure enough, when they did this,\n",

            "But that's when things got kind of funny,\n",
            "even funnier.\n",
            "The researchers were out in the parking lot,\n",
            "and they were counting people as they came in and out of the store,\n",
            "and they noticed that when the volunteers stood in front of both doors,\n",
            "people stopped coming out of the store at all.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Obviously, they were surprised by this, so they decided to look into it further,\n",

            "usually used to take out the recycling --\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "and now people were going out that door in order to avoid the volunteers.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "This teaches us an important lesson though.\n",
            "When we're trying to eliminate excuses, we need to be very thorough,\n",
            "because people are really creative in making them.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Alright, I want to switch to a setting\n",
            "where excuses can have deadly consequences.\n",

            "in fact, that it's had one for 70 years,\n",
            "a good one, one that works almost every time?\n",
            "It's incredible, but it's true.\n",
            "The disease is tuberculosis.\n",
            "It infects some 10 million people a year,\n",
            "and it kills almost two million of them.\n",
            "Like the blackout prevention program, we've got the solution.\n",
            "The problem is people.\n",
            "People need to take their medication\n",

            "with a mobile health startup called Keheala\n",
            "to support TB patients as they undergo treatment.\n",
            "Now, you have to understand, TB treatment, it's really tough.\n",
            "We're talking about taking a really strong antibiotic\n",
            "every single day for six months or more.\n",
            "That antibiotic is so strong that it will make you feel sick.\n",
            "It will make you feel nauseous and dizzy.\n",
            "It will make your pee turn funny colors.\n",
            "It's also a problem because you have to go back to the clinic\n",
            "about every week in order to get more pills,\n",
            "and in sub-Saharan Africa or other places where TB is common,\n",
            "now you're talking about going someplace pretty far,\n",
            "taking tough and slow public transport,\n",
            "maybe the clinic is inefficient.\n",
            "So now you're talking about taking a half day off of work every week\n",
            "from a job you desperately can't afford to lose.\n",
            "It's even worse when you consider the fact that there's a terrible stigma,\n",
            "and you desperately don't want people to find that you have the disease.\n",
            "Some of the toughest stories we hear are actually from women\n",
            "who, in these places where domestic violence can be kind of common,\n",
            "they tell us that they have to hide it from their husbands\n",
            "that they're coming to the clinic.\n",
            "So it's no surprise that people don't complete treatment.\n",
            "Can our approach really help them?\n",
            "Can we really get them to stick it out?\n",
            "Yeah.\n",
            "Every day, we text patients to remind them to take their medication,\n",
            "but if we stopped there,\n",
            "there'd be lots of excuses.\n",
            "\"Well, I didn't see the text.\"\n",
            "Or, \"You know, I saw the text, but then I totally forgot,\n",
            "put the phone down and I just forgot about it.\"\n",
            "Or, \"I lent the phone out to my mom.\"\n",
            "We have to eliminate these excuses\n",
            "and we do that by asking patients\n",
            "to log in and verify that they've taken their medication.\n",
            "If they don't log in, we text them again.\n",
            "If they don't log in, we text them yet again.\n",
            "If, after three times, they still haven't verified,\n",
            "we notify a team of supporters\n",
            "and that team will call and text them\n",
            "to try to get them back on the wagon.\n",
            "No excuses.\n",
            "Our approach, which, admittedly, uses all sorts of behavioral techniques,\n",
            "including, as you've probably noticed, observability,\n",
            "it was very effective.\n",
            "Patients without access to our platform\n",
            "were three times more likely not to complete treatment.\n",
            "Alright,\n",
            "you've increased observability,\n",
            "you've eliminated excuses,\n",
            "but there's still a third thing you need to be aware of.\n",
            "If you've been to Washington, DC or Japan or London,\n",
            "you know that metro riders there\n",
            "will be very careful to stand on the right-hand side of the escalator\n",
            "so that people can go by on the left.\n",
            "But unfortunately, not everywhere is that the norm,\n",
            "and there's plenty of places where you can just stand on both sides\n",
            "and block the escalator.\n",
            "Obviously, it's better for others\n",
            "when we stand on the right and let them go by,\n",
            "but we're only expected to do that some places.\n",
            "This is a general phenomenon.\n",
            "Sometimes we're expected to do good\n",
            "and sometimes not,\n",
            "and it means that people are really sensitive to cues\n",
            "that they're expected to do good in a particular situation,\n",
            "which brings us to the third and final item on our checklist:\n",

            "a small insert that compares their energy consumption\n",

            "you start to lose control over the output of your job.\n",
            "I've actually witnessed this firsthand.\n",
            "So, I started a company called Boxed in our garage,\n",

            "you know, there's a pressure washer in the back --\n",

            "or that's what she said, she was really proud of me --\n",
            "and so she would give me a hug, and I'm pretty sure she had her phone up\n",
            "and she was thinking, \"Oh, is John from Harvard still single?\"\n",
            "It was kind of like a lemonade stand gone wrong in the beginning,\n",
            "but we actually went up and said mobile commerce is going to be big,\n",
            "and actually consumer packaged goods were going to change over time,\n",
            "so let's take these big, bulky packs that you don't want to lug home --\n",
            "so not the two-pack of Oreo cookies but the 24-pack\n",
            "and not the 24-pack of toilet paper but the 48-pack --\n",
            "and let's ship it to you much like a warehouse club would do\n",
            "except they wouldn't ship it to you.\n",
            "So that's what we basically did.\n",
            "We had a really slow printer\n",
            "and what we did was actually say, \"OK, this printer is taking forever, man.\n",
            "Let's scribble something that would delight the customer\n",
            "on the back of these invoices.\"\n",
            "So we'd say, \"Hey, keep smiling,\" you know?\n",
            "\"Hey, you're awesome,\"\n",
            "or, \"Hey, enjoy the Doritos,\"\n",
            "or, \"We love Gatorade, too.\"\n",
            "Stuff like that.\n",
            "And so it started breaking up the monotony of the job as well\n",
            "because I was picking and packing all of the boxes,\n",
            "and that's all you basically do for eight, nine, 10, 12 hours a day\n",
            "when you're sitting in the garage.\n",
            "And so an interesting thing happened.\n",
            "So we actually started to grow.\n",
            "And so, you know, over the last --\n",
            "actually just even 36 months after that,\n",
            "we ended up selling hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stuff,\n",
            "and we actually grew really, really quickly.\n",
            "But during that time, my role started to change, too.\n",
            "So, yes, I was the CEO in the garage;\n",
            "I was picking and packing, doing all the work,\n",
            "but then I graduated\n",
            "to actually managing the people who picked and packed,\n",
            "and then pretty soon I managed the people\n",
            "who managed the people picking and packing.\n",

In a talk and live demo, Cage presents a scene from his new project, letting the audience control a character's decisions. \"Interactive storytelling can be what cinema was in the 20th century: an art that deeply changes its time,\" Cage says.\n\nCheck out more TED Talks: ",

            "and yet we know they drive complex planetary systems\n",
            "like global weather,\n",

            "better known as NOAA,\n",
            "only has 16 ships,\n",
            "and there are less than 200 buoys offshore globally.\n",
            "It is easy to understand why:\n",
            "the oceans are an unforgiving place,\n",
            "and to collect in situ data, you need a big ship,\n",

            "Some of that heat generates evaporation, which creates clouds\n",
            "and then eventually leads to precipitation.\n",
            "And pressure gradients create surface wind,\n",
            "which moves the moisture through the atmosphere.\n",
            "Some of the heat radiates down into the deep ocean\n",

            "The challenge in studying those ocean variables at scale\n",
            "is one of energy,\n",
            "the energy that it takes to deploy sensors into the deep ocean.\n",
            "And of course, many solutions have been tried --\n",
            "from wave-actuated devices\n",

            "the pursuit of the world speed record in a wind-powered land yacht.\n",

            "between the US and Russia.\n",
            "Now, the Bering Sea is the home of the walleye pollock,\n",
            "which is a whitefish you might not recognize,\n",
            "but you might likely have tasted if you enjoy fish sticks or surimi.\n",
            "Yes, surimi looks like crabmeat, but it's actually pollock.\n",
            "And the pollock fishery is the largest fishery in the nation,\n",
            "both in terms of value and volume --\n",
            "about 3.1 billion pounds of fish caught every year.\n",
            "So over the past few years, a fleet of ocean drones\n",
            "has been hard at work in the Bering Sea\n",
            "with the goal to help assess the size of the pollock fish stock.\n",
            "This helps improve the quota system that's used to manage the fishery\n",
            "and help prevent a collapse of the fish stock\n",
            "and protects this fragile ecosystem.\n",
            "Now, the drones survey the fishing ground using acoustics,\n",
            "i.e., a sonar.\n",
            "This sends a sound wave downwards,\n",
            "and then the reflection, the echo from the sound wave\n",
            "from the seabed or schools of fish,\n",
            "gives us an idea of what's happening below the surface.\n",
            "Our ocean drones are actually pretty good at this repetitive task,\n",
            "so they have been gridding the Bering Sea day in, day out.\n",
            "Now, the Pribilof Islands are also the home of a large colony of fur seals.\n",
            "In the 1950s, there were about two million individuals in that colony.\n",
            "Sadly, these days, the population has rapidly declined.\n",
            "There's less than 50 percent of that number left,\n",
            "and the population continues to fall rapidly.\n",
            "So to understand why,\n",
            "our science partner at the National Marine Mammal Laboratory\n",
            "has fitted a GPS tag on some of the mother seals,\n",
            "glued to their furs.\n",
            "And this tag measures location and depth\n",
            "and also has a really cool little camera\n",
            "that's triggered by sudden acceleration.\n",
            "Here is a movie taken by an artistically inclined seal,\n",
            "giving us unprecedented insight into an underwater hunt\n",
            "deep in the Arctic,\n",
            "and the shot of this pollock prey\n",
            "just seconds before it gets devoured.\n",
            "Now, doing work in the Arctic is very tough, even for a robot.\n",
            "They had to survive a snowstorm in August\n",
            "and interferences from bystanders --\n",
            "that little spotted seal enjoying a ride.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Now, the seal tags have recorded over 200,000 dives over the season,\n",
            "and upon a closer look,\n",
            "we get to see the individual seal tracks and the repetitive dives.\n",
            "We are on our way to decode what is really happening\n",
            "over that foraging ground,\n",
            "and it's quite beautiful.\n",
            "Once you superimpose the acoustic data collected by the drones,\n",
            "a picture starts to emerge.\n",
            "As the seals leave the islands and swim from left to right,\n",
            "they are observed to dive at a relatively shallow depth of about 20 meters,\n",
            "which the drone identifies is populated by small young pollock\n",
            "with low calorific content.\n",
            "The seals then swim much greater distance and start to dive deeper\n",
            "to a place where the drone identifies larger, more adult pollock,\n",
            "which are more nutritious as fish.\n",
            "Unfortunately, the calories expended by the mother seals\n",
            "to swim this extra distance\n",
            "don't leave them with enough energy to lactate their pups back on the island,\n",
            "leading to the population decline.\n",
            "Further, the drones identify that the water temperature around the island\n",
            "has significantly warmed.\n",
            "It might be one of the driving forces that's pushing the pollock north,\n",
            "and to spread in search of colder regions.\n",
            "So the data analysis is ongoing,\n",
            "but already we can see that some of the pieces of the puzzle\n",
            "from the fur seal mystery\n",
            "are coming into focus.\n",
            "But if you look back at the big picture,\n",
            "we are mammals, too.\n",
            "And actually, the oceans provide up to 20 kilos of fish per human per year.\n",
            "As we deplete our fish stocks, what can we humans learn\n",
            "from the fur seal story?\n",
            "And beyond fish, the oceans affect all of us daily\n",
            "as they drive global weather systems,\n",
            "which affect things like global agricultural output\n",
            "or can lead to devastating destruction of lives and property\n",
            "through hurricanes, extreme heat and floods.\n",

            "It was a beautiful September morning, and as I climbed higher,\n",
            "I could hear the sounds of tourists chatting and laughing on the summit.\n",

            "I carefully balanced my way upward,\n",
            "shifting my weight back and forth between the small smears.\n",
            "But then I reached a foothold that I didn't quite trust.\n",
            "Two days ago, I'd have just stepped right up on it,\n",
            "but that would have been with a rope on.\n",
            "Now it felt too small and too slippery.\n",
            "I doubted that my foot would stay on if I weighted it.\n",
            "I considered a foot further to the side, which seemed worse.\n",

            "My mind was racing in every direction.\n",
            "I knew what I had to do, but I was too afraid to do it.\n",
            "I just had to stand up on my right foot.\n",
            "And so after what felt like an eternity, I accepted what I had to do\n",

            "and it didn't slip, and so I didn't die,\n",
            "and that move marked the end of the hardest climbing.\n",
            "And so I charged from there towards the summit.\n",
            "And so normally when you summit Half Dome,\n",
            "you have a rope and a bunch of climbing gear on you,\n",

            "(Laughter)\n",
            "I didn't bother to explain,\n",
            "but that night in my climbing journal, I duly noted my free solo of Half Dome,\n",
            "but I included a frowny face and a comment, \"Do better?\"\n",
            "I'd succeeded in the solo\n",
            "and it was celebrated as a big first in climbing.\n",
            "Some friends later made a film about it.\n",
            "But I was unsatisfied.\n",
            "I was disappointed in my performance,\n",
            "because I knew that I had gotten away with something.\n",
            "I didn't want to be a lucky climber. I wanted to be a great climber.\n",
            "I actually took the next year or so off from free soloing,\n",
            "because I knew that I shouldn't make a habit of relying on luck.\n",
            "But even though I wasn't soloing very much,\n",
            "I'd already started to think about El Cap.\n",
            "It was always in the back of my mind as the obvious crown jewel of solos.\n",
            "It's the most striking wall in the world.\n",
            "Each year, for the next seven years,\n",
            "I'd think, \"This is the year that I'm going to solo El Cap.\"\n",
            "And then I would drive into Yosemite, look up at the wall, and think,\n",
            "\"No frickin' way.\"\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "It's too big and too scary.\n",
            "But eventually I came to accept that I wanted to test myself against El Cap.\n",
            "It represented true mastery,\n",
            "but I needed it to feel different.\n",
            "I didn't want to get away with anything or barely squeak by.\n",
            "This time I wanted to do it right.\n",
            "The thing that makes El Cap so intimidating\n",
            "is the sheer scale of the wall.\n",
            "Most climbers take three to five days\n",
            "to ascend the 3,000 feet of vertical granite.\n",
            "The idea of setting out up a wall of that size\n",
            "with nothing but shoes and a chalk bag seemed impossible.\n",
            "3,000 feet of climbing represents\n",
            "thousands of distinct hand and foot movements,\n",
            "which is a lot to remember.\n",
            "Many of the moves I knew through sheer repetition.\n",
            "I'd climbed El Cap maybe 50 times over the previous decade with a rope.\n",
            "But this photo shows my preferred method of rehearsing the moves.\n",
            "I'm on the summit,\n",
            "about to rappel down the face with over a thousand feet of rope\n",
            "to spend the day practicing.\n",
            "Once I found sequences that felt secure and repeatable,\n",
            "I had to memorize them.\n",
            "I had to make sure that they were so deeply ingrained within me\n",
            "that there was no possibility of error.\n",
            "I didn't want to be wondering if I was going the right way\n",
            "or using the best holds.\n",
            "I needed everything to feel automatic.\n",
            "Climbing with a rope is a largely physical effort.\n",
            "You just have to be strong enough to hold on and make the movements upward.\n",
            "But free soloing plays out more in the mind.\n",
            "The physical effort is largely the same.\n",
            "Your body is still climbing the same wall.\n",
            "But staying calm and performing at your best\n",
            "when you know that any mistake could mean death\n",
            "requires a certain kind of mindset.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "That's not supposed to be funny, but if it is, it is.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "I worked to cultivate that mindset through visualization,\n",
            "which basically just means imagining the entire experience of soloing the wall.\n",
            "Partially, that was to help me remember all the holds,\n",
            "but mostly visualization was about feeling the texture\n",
            "of each hold in my hand\n",
            "and imagining the sensation of my leg reaching out and placing my foot just so.\n",
            "I'd imagine it all like a choreographed dance thousands of feet up.\n",
            "The most difficult part of the whole route was called the Boulder Problem.\n",
            "It was about 2,000 feet off the ground\n",
            "and consisted of the hardest physical moves on the whole route:\n",
            "long pulls between poor handholds with very small, slippery feet.\n",
            "This is what I mean by a poor handhold:\n",
            "an edge smaller than the width of a pencil but facing downward\n",
            "that I had to press up into with my thumb.\n",
            "But that wasn't even the hardest part.\n",
            "The crux culminated in a karate kick\n",
            "with my left foot over to the inside of an adjacent corner,\n",
            "a maneuver that required a high degree of precision and flexibility,\n",
            "enough so that I'd been doing a nightly stretching routine\n",
            "for a full year ahead of time\n",
            "to make sure that I could comfortably make the reach with my leg.\n",
            "As I practiced the moves,\n",
            "my visualization turned to the emotional component\n",
            "of a potential solo.\n",
            "Basically, what if I got up there and it was too scary?\n",
            "What if I was too tired?\n",
            "What if I couldn't quite make the kick?\n",
            "I had to consider every possibility while I was safely on the ground,\n",
            "so that when the time came and I was actually making the moves without a rope,\n",
            "there was no room for doubt to creep in.\n",
            "Doubt is the precursor to fear,\n",
            "and I knew that I couldn't experience my perfect moment if I was afraid.\n",
            "I had to visualize and rehearse enough to remove all doubt.\n",
            "But beyond that, I also visualized how it would feel\n",
            "if it never seemed doable.\n",
            "What if, after so much work, I was afraid to try?\n",
            "What if I was wasting my time\n",
            "and I would never feel comfortable in such an exposed position?\n",
            "There were no easy answers,\n",
            "but El Cap meant enough to me that I would put in the work and find out.\n",
            "Some of my preparations were more mundane.\n",
            "This is a photo of my friend Conrad Anker\n",
            "climbing up the bottom of El Cap with an empty backpack.\n",
            "We spent the day climbing together\n",
            "to a specific crack in the middle of the wall\n",
            "that was choked with loose rocks\n",
            "that made that section difficult and potentially dangerous,\n",
            "because any missed step might knock a rock to the ground\n",
            "and kill a passing climber or hiker.\n",
            "So we carefully removed the rocks, loaded them into the pack\n",
            "and rappelled back down.\n",
            "Take a second to imagine how ridiculous it feels\n",
            "to climb 1,500 feet up a wall just to fill a backpack full of rocks.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "It's never that easy to carry a pack full of rocks around.\n",
            "It's even harder on the side of a cliff.\n",
            "It may have felt silly, but it still had to get done.\n",
            "I needed everything to feel perfect\n",
            "if I was ever going to climb the route without a rope.\n",
            "After two seasons of working specifically toward a potential free solo of El Cap,\n",
            "I finally finished all my preparations.\n",
            "I knew every handhold and foothold on the whole route,\n",
            "and I knew exactly what to do.\n",
            "Basically, I was ready.\n",
            "It was time to solo El Cap.\n",
            "On June 3, 2017,\n",
            "I woke up early, ate my usual breakfast of muesli and fruit\n",
            "and made it to the base of the wall before sunrise.\n",
            "I felt confident as I looked up the wall.\n",
            "I felt even better as I started climbing.\n",
            "About 500 feet up, I reached a slab\n",
            "very similar to the one that had given me so much trouble on Half Dome,\n",
            "but this time was different.\n",
            "I'd scouted every option, including hundreds of feet of wall to either side.\n",
            "I knew exactly what to do and how to do it.\n",
            "I had no doubts. I just climbed right through.\n",
            "Even the difficult and strenuous sections passed by with ease.\n",
            "I was perfectly executing my routine.\n",
            "I rested for a moment below the Boulder Problem\n",
            "and then climbed it just as I had practiced so many times with the rope on.\n",
            "My foot shot across to the wall on the left without hesitation,\n",
            "and I knew that I had done it.\n",
            "Climbing Half Dome had been a big goal\n",
            "and I did it,\n",
            "but I didn't get what I really wanted.\n",
            "I didn't achieve mastery.\n",
            "I was hesitant and afraid, and it wasn't the experience that I wanted.\n",
            "But El Cap was different.\n",
            "With 600 feet to go, I felt like the mountain was offering me a victory lap.\n",
            "I climbed with a smooth precision\n",
            "and enjoyed the sounds of the birds swooping around the cliff.\n",
            "It all felt like a celebration.\n",
            "And then I reached the summit\n",
            "after three hours and 56 minutes of glorious climbing.\n",
            "It was the climb that I wanted, and it felt like mastery.\n",

            "we're in the hospital for weeks,\n",
            "and often left with scars and painful side effects\n",
            "of our inability to regenerate or regrow healthy, uninjured organs.\n",
            "I work to create materials\n",
            "that instruct our immune system to give us the signals to grow new tissues.\n",
            "Just like vaccines instruct our body to fight disease,\n",
            "we could instead instruct our immune system\n",
            "to build tissues and more quickly heal wounds.\n",
            "Now, regrowing body parts out of nowhere might seem like magic,\n",
            "but there are several organisms that can achieve this feat.\n",
            "Some lizards can regrow their tails,\n",
            "the humble salamander can completely regenerate their arm,\n",
            "and even us mere humans can regrow our liver\n",
            "after losing more than half of its original mass.\n",
            "To make this magic a bit closer to reality,\n",
            "I'm investigating how our body can heal wounds and build tissue\n",
            "through instructions from the immune system.\n",
            "From a scrape on your knee to that annoying sinus infection,\n",
            "our immune system defends our body from danger.\n",
            "I'm an immunologist,\n",
            "and by using what I know about our body's defense system,\n",
            "I was able to identify key players\n",
            "in our fight to build back our cuts and bruises.\n",
            "When looking at materials that are currently being tested\n",
            "for their abilities to help regrow muscle,\n",
            "our team noticed that after treating an injured muscle with these materials,\n",
            "there was a large number of immune cells\n",
            "in that material and the surrounding muscle.\n",
            "So in this case,\n",
            "instead of the immune cells rushing off towards infection to fight bacteria,\n",
            "they're rushing toward an injury.\n",
            "I discovered a specific type of immune cell,\n",
            "the helper T cell,\n",
            "was present inside that material that I implanted\n",
            "and absolutely critical for wound healing.\n",
            "Now, just like when you were a kid and you'd break your pencil\n",
            "and try and tape it back together again,\n",
            "we can heal,\n",
            "but it might not be in the most functional way,\n",
            "and we'll get a scar.\n",
            "So if we don't have these helper T cells,\n",
            "instead of healthy muscle,\n",
            "our muscle develops fat cells inside of it,\n",
            "and if there's fat in our muscle, it isn't as strong.\n",
            "Now, using our immune system,\n",
            "our body could grow back without these scars\n",
            "and look like what it was before we were even injured.\n",
            "I'm working to create materials\n",
            "that give us the signals to build new tissue\n",
            "by changing the immune response.\n",
            "We know that any time a material is implanted in our body,\n",
            "the immune system will respond to it.\n",
            "This ranges from pacemakers to insulin pumps\n",
            "to the materials that engineers are using to try and build new tissue.\n",
            "So when I place that material, or scaffold, in the body,\n",
            "the immune system creates a small environment of cells and proteins\n",
            "that can change the way that our stem cells behave.\n",
            "Now, just like the weather affects our daily activities,\n",
            "like going for a run\n",
            "or staying inside and binge-watching an entire TV show on Netflix,\n",
            "the immune environment of a scaffold\n",
            "affects the way that our stem cells grow and develop.\n",
            "If we have the wrong signals,\n",
            "say the Netflix signals,\n",
            "we get fat cells instead of muscle.\n",
            "These scaffolds are made of a variety of different things,\n",
            "from plastics to naturally derived materials,\n",
            "nanofibers of varying thicknesses,\n",
            "sponges that are more or less porous,\n",
            "gels of different stiffnesses.\n",
            "And researchers can even make the materials\n",
            "release different signals over time.\n",
            "So in other words, we can orchestrate this Broadway show of cells\n",
            "by giving them the correct stage, cues and props\n",
            "that can be changed for different tissues,\n",
            "just like a producer would change the set\n",
            "for \"Les Mis\" versus \"Little Shop of Horrors.\"\n",
            "I'm combining specific types of signals\n",
            "that mimic how our body responds to injury to help us regenerate.\n",
            "In the future, we could see a scar-proof band-aid,\n",
            "a moldable muscle filler or even a wound-healing vaccine.\n",
            "Now, we aren't going to wake up tomorrow and be able to heal like Wolverine.\n",
            "Probably not next Tuesday, either.\n",
            "But with these advances,\n",
            "and working with our immune system to help build tissue and heal wounds,\n",
            "we could begin seeing products on the market\n",
            "that work with our body's defense system to help us regenerate,\n",
            "and maybe one day be able to keep pace with a salamander.\n",

            "How many people here have children?\n",
            "And how many of you are confident\n",
            "that you know how to bring up your children\n",
            "in exactly the right way?\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "OK, I don't see too many hands going up on that second one,\n",
            "and that's my confession, too.\n",
            "I've got three boys;\n",
            "they're three, nine and 12.\n",
            "And like you, and like most parents,\n",
            "the honest truth is I have pretty much no idea what I'm doing.\n",
            "I want them to be happy and healthy in their lives,\n",
            "but I don't know what I'm supposed to do\n",
            "to make sure they are happy and healthy.\n",
            "There's so many books offering all kinds of conflicting advice,\n",
            "it can be really overwhelming.\n",
            "So I've spent most of their lives just making it up as I go along.\n",
            "However, something changed me a few years ago,\n",
            "when I came across a little secret that we have in Britain.\n",
            "It's helped me become more confident about how I bring up my own children,\n",
            "and it's revealed a lot about how we as a society can help all children.\n",
            "I want to share that secret with you today.\n",
            "For the last 70 years,\n",
            "scientists in Britain have been following thousands of children through their lives\n",
            "as part of an incredible scientific study.\n",
            "There's nothing quite like it anywhere else in the world.\n",
            "Collecting information on thousands of children\n",
            "is a really powerful thing to do,\n",
            "because it means we can compare the ones who say,\n",
            "do well at school or end up healthy or happy or wealthy as adults,\n",
            "and the ones who struggle much more,\n",
            "and then we can sift through all the information we've collected\n",
            "and try to work out why their lives turned out different.\n",
            "This British study -- it's actually a kind of crazy story.\n",
            "So it all starts back in 1946,\n",
            "just a few months after the end of the war,\n",
            "when scientists wanted to know\n",
            "what it was like for a woman to have a baby at the time.\n",
            "They carried out this huge survey of mothers\n",
            "and ended up recording the birth of nearly every baby\n",
            "born in England, Scotland and Wales in one week.\n",
            "That was nearly 14,000 babies.\n",
            "The questions they asked these women\n",
            "are very different than the ones we might ask today.\n",
            "They sound really old-fashioned now.\n",
            "They asked them things like,\n",
            "\"During pregnancy,\n",
            "did you get your full extra ration of a pint of milk a day?\"\n",
            "\"How much did you spend on smocks, corsets,\n",
            "nightdresses, knickers and brassieres?\"\n",
            "And this is my favorite one:\n",
            "\"Who looked after your husband while you were in bed with this baby?\"\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Now, this wartime study actually ended up being so successful\n",
            "that scientists did it again.\n",
            "They recorded the births of thousands of babies born in 1958\n",
            "and thousands more in 1970.\n",
            "They did it again in the early 1990s,\n",
            "and again at the turn of the millennium.\n",
            "Altogether, more than 70,000 children have been involved in these studies\n",
            "across those five generations.\n",
            "They're called the British birth cohorts,\n",
            "and scientists have gone back and recorded more information\n",
            "on all of these people every few years ever since.\n",
            "The amount of information that's now been collected on these people\n",
            "is just completely mind-boggling.\n",
            "It includes thousands of paper questionnaires\n",
            "and terabytes' worth of computer data.\n",
            "Scientists have also built up a huge bank of tissue samples,\n",
            "which includes locks of hair, nail clippings, baby teeth and DNA.\n",
            "They've even collected 9,000 placentas from some of the births,\n",
            "which are now pickled in plastic buckets in a secure storage warehouse.\n",
            "This whole project has become unique --\n",
            "so, no other country in the world is tracking generations of children\n",
            "in quite this detail.\n",
            "These are some of the best-studied people on the planet,\n",
            "and the data has become incredibly valuable for scientists,\n",
            "generating well over 6,000 academic papers and books.\n",
            "But today I want to focus on just one finding --\n",
            "perhaps the most important discovery to come from this remarkable study.\n",
            "And it's also the one that spoke to me personally,\n",
            "because it's about how to use science to do the best for our children.\n",
            "So, let's get the bad news out of the way first.\n",
            "Perhaps the biggest message from this remarkable study is this:\n",
            "don't be born into poverty or into disadvantage,\n",
            "because if you are,\n",
            "you're far more likely to walk a difficult path in life.\n",
            "Many children in this study were born into poor families\n",
            "or into working-class families that had cramped homes or other problems,\n",
            "and it's clear now that those disadvantaged children\n",
            "have been more likely to struggle on almost every score.\n",
            "They've been more likely to do worse at school,\n",
            "to end up with worse jobs and to earn less money.\n",
            "Now, maybe that sounds really obvious,\n",
            "but some of the results have been really surprising,\n",
            "so children who had a tough start in life\n",
            "are also more likely to end up unhealthy as adults.\n",
            "They're more likely to be overweight,\n",
            "to have high blood pressure,\n",
            "and then decades down the line,\n",
            "more likely to have a failing memory, poor health and even to die earlier.\n",
            "Now, I talked about what happens later,\n",
            "but some of these differences emerge at a really shockingly early age.\n",
            "In one study,\n",
            "children who were growing up in poverty\n",
            "were almost a year behind the richer children on educational tests,\n",
            "and that was by the age of just three.\n",
            "These types of differences have been found again and again across the generations.\n",
            "It means that our early circumstances have a profound influence\n",
            "on the way that the rest of our lives play out.\n",
            "And working out why that is\n",
            "is one of the most difficult questions that we face today.\n",
            "So there we have it.\n",
            "The first lesson for successful life, everyone, is this:\n",
            "choose your parents very carefully.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Don't be born into a poor family or into a struggling family.\n",
            "Now, I'm sure you can see the small problem here.\n",
            "We can't choose our parents or how much they earn,\n",
            "but this British study has also struck a real note of optimism\n",
            "by showing that not everyone who has a disadvantaged start\n",
            "ends up in difficult circumstances.\n",
            "As you know, many people have a tough start in life,\n",
            "but they end up doing very well on some measure nevertheless,\n",
            "and this study starts to explain how.\n",
            "So the second lesson is this:\n",
            "parents really matter.\n",
            "In this study,\n",
            "children who had engaged, interested parents,\n",
            "ones who had ambition for their future,\n",
            "were more likely to escape from a difficult start.\n",
            "It seems that parents and what they do are really, really important,\n",
            "especially in the first few years of life.\n",
            "Let me give you an example of that.\n",
            "In one study,\n",
            "scientists looked at about 17,000 children who were born in 1970.\n",
            "They sifted all the mountains of data that they had collected\n",
            "to try to work out\n",
            "what allowed the children who'd had a difficult start in life\n",
            "to go on and do well at school nevertheless.\n",
            "In other words, which ones beat the odds.\n",
            "The data showed that what mattered more than anything else was parents.\n",
            "Having engaged, interested parents in those first few years of life\n",
            "was strongly linked to children going on to do well at school later on.\n",
            "In fact, quite small things that parents do\n",
            "are associated with good outcomes for children.\n",
            "Talking and listening to a child,\n",
            "responding to them warmly,\n",
            "teaching them their letters and numbers,\n",
            "taking them on trips and visits.\n",
            "Reading to children every day seems to be really important, too.\n",
            "So in one study,\n",
            "children whose parents were reading to them daily when they were five\n",
            "and then showing an interest in their education at the age of 10,\n",
            "were significantly less likely to be in poverty at the age of 30\n",
            "than those whose parents weren't doing those things.\n",
            "Now, there are huge challenges with interpreting this type of science.\n",
            "These studies show that certain things that parents do\n",
            "are correlated with good outcomes for children,\n",
            "but we don't necessarily know those behaviors caused the good outcomes,\n",
            "or whether some other factor is getting in the way.\n",
            "For example, we have to take genes into account,\n",
            "and that's a whole other talk in itself.\n",
            "But scientists working with this British study\n",
            "are working really hard to get at causes,\n",
            "and this is one study I particularly love.\n",
            "In this one,\n",
            "they looked at the bedtime routines of about 10,000 children\n",
            "born at the turn of the millennium.\n",
            "Were the children going to bed at regular times,\n",
            "or did they go to bed at different times during the week?\n",
            "The data showed that those children who were going to bed at different times\n",
            "were more likely to have behavioral problems,\n",
            "and then those that switched to having regular bedtimes\n",
            "often showed an improvement in behavior,\n",
            "and that was really crucial,\n",
            "because it suggested it was the bedtime routines\n",
            "that were really helping things get better for those kids.\n",
            "Here's another one to think about.\n",
            "In this one,\n",
            "scientists looked at children who were reading for pleasure.\n",
            "That means that they picked up a magazine, a picture book, a story book.\n",
            "The data showed that children who were reading for pleasure\n",
            "at the ages of five and 10\n",
            "were more likely to go on in school better, on average,\n",
            "on school tests later in their lives.\n",
            "And not just tests of reading,\n",
            "but tests of spelling and maths as well.\n",
            "This study tried to control for all the confounding factors,\n",
            "so it looked at children who were equally intelligent\n",
            "and from the same social-class background,\n",
            "so it seemed as if it was the reading which really helped those children\n",
            "go on and score better on those school tests later in their lives.\n",
            "Now at the start,\n",
            "I said the first lesson from this study\n",
            "was not to be born into poverty or into disadvantage,\n",
            "because those children tend to follow more difficult paths in their lives.\n",
            "But then I said that parenting matters,\n",
            "and that good parenting, if you can call it that,\n",
            "helps children beat the odds\n",
            "and overcome some of those early disadvantages.\n",
            "So wait,\n",

            "to the contrary.\n",
            "He would have thought,\n",
            "well, there may be negative consequences,\n",
            "for example,\n",
            "the owner might be angry with the dog\n",
            "and the dog, anticipating that, might not behave in this way.\n",
            "That might be us,\n",

            "a code of conduct.\n",
            "And then if you behave according to that code of conduct,\n",
            "that improves your chances of getting a bonus payment.\n",
            "And on the other hand, if you disregard it,\n",
            "then there are higher chances of not getting your bonus\n",
            "or its being diminished.\n",
            "In other words,\n",
            "this is a very economic motivation\n",
            "of trying to get people to be more honest,\n",
            "or more aligned with the corporation's principles.\n",

            "We try to build a reputation,\n",

            "because then people trust us more in the future.\n",
            "Right?\n",
            "Adam Smith talked about the baker\n",

            "have bad media coverage.\n",
            "They lose net new money in the future\n",
            "and therefore make lower profits.\n",
            "That's a very powerful reputational force.\n",
            "Benefits and costs.\n",
            "Here's another viewpoint of the world.\n",
            "Meet Immanuel Kant,\n",
            "18th-century German philosopher superstar.\n",
            "He developed this notion\n",
            "that independent of the consequences,\n",

            "and some are just wrong.\n",

            "and risk ruining all this beautiful tableware.\n",
            "If you believe that people are motivated like that,\n",

            "all the stuff about code of conduct and bonus systems and so on,\n",
            "doesn't make a whole lot of sense.\n",
            "People are motivated by different values perhaps.\n",
            "So, what are people actually motivated by?\n",
            "These two gentlemen here have perfect hairdos,\n",
            "but they give us very different views of the world.\n",
            "What do we do with this?\n",
            "Well, I'm an economist\n",
            "and we conduct so-called experiments to address this issue.\n",
            "We strip away facts which are confusing in reality.\n",

            "it's almost impossible to know what drives people's behavior really.\n",
            "So let's do a little experiment together.\n",
            "Imagine the following situation.\n",
            "You're in a room alone,\n",
            "not like here.\n",
            "There's a five-franc coin like the one I'm holding up right now\n",

            "Here are your instructions:\n",
            "toss the coin four times,\n",

            "enter the number of times tails came up.\n",
            "This is the situation.\n",
            "Here's the rub.\n",
            "For every time that you announce that you had a tails throw,\n",
            "you get paid five francs.\n",
            "So if you say I had two tails throws,\n",
            "you get paid 10 francs.\n",
            "If you say you had zero, you get paid zero francs.\n",
            "If you say, \"I had four tails throws,\"\n",
            "then you get paid 20 francs.\n",
            "It's anonymous,\n",
            "nobody's watching what you're doing,\n",
            "and you get paid that money anonymously.\n",

            "You know what's coming now, right?\n",
            "First, how would you behave in that situation?\n",
            "The second, look to your left and look to your right --\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "and think about how the person sitting next to you\n",
            "might behave in that situation.\n",
            "We did this experiment for real.\n",
            "We did it at the Manifesta art exhibition\n",
            "that took place here in Zurich recently,\n",
            "not with students in the lab at the university\n",
            "but with the real population,\n",
            "like you guys.\n",
            "First, a quick reminder of stats.\n",
            "If I throw the coin four times and it's a fair coin,\n",
            "then the probability that it comes up four times tails\n",
            "is 6.25 percent.\n",
            "And I hope you can intuitively see\n",
            "that the probability that all four of them are tails is much lower\n",
            "than if two of them are tails, right?\n",
            "Here are the specific numbers.\n",
            "Here's what happened.\n",
            "People did this experiment for real.\n",
            "Around 30 to 35 percent of people said,\n",
            "\"Well, I had four tails throws.\"\n",
            "That's extremely unlikely.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "But the really amazing thing here,\n",
            "perhaps to an economist,\n",
            "is there are around 65 percent of people who did not say I had four tails throws,\n",
            "even though in that situation,\n",
            "nobody's watching you,\n",
            "the only consequence that's in place\n",
            "is you get more money if you say four than less.\n",
            "You leave 20 francs on the table by announcing zero.\n",
            "I don't know whether the other people all were honest\n",
            "or whether they also said a little bit higher or lower than what they did\n",
            "because it's anonymous.\n",
            "We only observed the distribution.\n",
            "But what I can tell you -- and here's another coin toss.\n",
            "There you go, it's tails.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Don't check, OK?\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "What I can tell you\n",
            "is that not everybody behaved like Adam Smith would have predicted.\n",
            "So what does that leave us with?\n",
            "Well, it seems people are motivated by certain intrinsic values\n",
            "and in our research, we look at this.\n",
            "We look at the idea that people have so-called protected values.\n",
            "A protected value isn't just any value.\n",
            "A protected value is a value where you're willing to pay a price\n",
            "to uphold that value.\n",
            "You're willing to pay a price to withstand the temptation to give in.\n",
            "And the consequence is you feel better\n",
            "if you earn money in a way that's consistent with your values.\n",
            "Let me show you this again in the metaphor of our beloved dog here.\n",
            "If we succeed in getting the sausage without violating our values,\n",
            "then the sausage tastes better.\n",
            "That's what our research shows.\n",
            "If, on the other hand,\n",
            "we do so --\n",
            "if we get the sausage\n",
            "and in doing so we actually violate values,\n",
            "we value the sausage less.\n",
            "Quantitatively, that's quite powerful.\n",

            "Simple, nine-item survey that's quite predictive in these experiments.\n",

            "The data showed that chasing happiness can make people unhappy.\n",
            "And what really struck me was this:\n",
            "the suicide rate has been rising around the world,\n",
            "and it recently reached a 30-year high in America.\n",
            "Even though life is getting objectively better\n",

            "and you don't have to be clinically depressed to feel it.\n",
            "Sooner or later, I think we all wonder:\n",
            "Is this all there is?\n",
            "And according to the research, what predicts this despair\n",
            "is not a lack of happiness.\n",
            "It's a lack of something else,\n",
            "a lack of having meaning in life.\n",
            "But that raised some questions for me.\n",
            "Is there more to life than being happy?\n",
            "And what's the difference between being happy\n",
            "and having meaning in life?\n",
            "Many psychologists define happiness as a state of comfort and ease,\n",
            "feeling good in the moment.\n",
            "Meaning, though, is deeper.\n",
            "The renowned psychologist Martin Seligman says\n",
            "meaning comes from belonging to and serving something beyond yourself\n",
            "and from developing the best within you.\n",
            "Our culture is obsessed with happiness,\n",
            "but I came to see that seeking meaning is the more fulfilling path.\n",
            "And the studies show that people who have meaning in life,\n",
            "they're more resilient,\n",
            "they do better in school and at work,\n",
            "and they even live longer.\n",
            "So this all made me wonder:\n",
            "How can we each live more meaningfully?\n",
            "To find out, I spent five years interviewing hundreds of people\n",

            "neuroscience and philosophy.\n",
            "Bringing it all together,\n",
            "I found that there are what I call four pillars of a meaningful life.\n",
            "And we can each create lives of meaning\n",
            "by building some or all of these pillars in our lives.\n",
            "The first pillar is belonging.\n",
            "Belonging comes from being in relationships\n",
            "where you're valued for who you are intrinsically\n",
            "and where you value others as well.\n",
            "But some groups and relationships deliver a cheap form of belonging;\n",
            "you're valued for what you believe,\n",
            "for who you hate,\n",
            "not for who you are.\n",
            "True belonging springs from love.\n",
            "It lives in moments among individuals,\n",
            "and it's a choice -- you can choose to cultivate belonging with others.\n",
            "Here's an example.\n",
            "Each morning, my friend Jonathan buys a newspaper\n",
            "from the same street vendor in New York.\n",
            "They don't just conduct a transaction, though.\n",
            "They take a moment to slow down, talk,\n",
            "and treat each other like humans.\n",
            "But one time, Jonathan didn't have the right change,\n",
            "and the vendor said,\n",
            "\"Don't worry about it.\"\n",
            "But Jonathan insisted on paying,\n",
            "so he went to the store and bought something he didn't need\n",
            "to make change.\n",
            "But when he gave the money to the vendor,\n",
            "the vendor drew back.\n",
            "He was hurt.\n",
            "He was trying to do something kind,\n",
            "but Jonathan had rejected him.\n",
            "I think we all reject people in small ways like this without realizing it.\n",
            "I do.\n",
            "I'll walk by someone I know and barely acknowledge them.\n",
            "I'll check my phone when someone's talking to me.\n",
            "These acts devalue others.\n",
            "They make them feel invisible and unworthy.\n",
            "But when you lead with love, you create a bond\n",
            "that lifts each of you up.\n",
            "For many people, belonging is the most essential source of meaning,\n",
            "those bonds to family and friends.\n",
            "For others, the key to meaning is the second pillar: purpose.\n",
            "Now, finding your purpose is not the same thing\n",
            "as finding that job that makes you happy.\n",
            "Purpose is less about what you want than about what you give.\n",
            "A hospital custodian told me her purpose is healing sick people.\n",
            "Many parents tell me,\n",
            "\"My purpose is raising my children.\"\n",
            "The key to purpose is using your strengths to serve others.\n",
            "Of course, for many of us, that happens through work.\n",
            "That's how we contribute and feel needed.\n",
            "But that also means that issues like disengagement at work,\n",
            "unemployment,\n",
            "low labor force participation --\n",
            "these aren't just economic problems, they're existential ones, too.\n",
            "Without something worthwhile to do,\n",
            "people flounder.\n",
            "Of course, you don't have to find purpose at work,\n",
            "but purpose gives you something to live for,\n",
            "some \"why\" that drives you forward.\n",
            "The third pillar of meaning is also about stepping beyond yourself,\n",
            "but in a completely different way:\n",
            "transcendence.\n",
            "Transcendent states are those rare moments\n",
            "when you're lifted above the hustle and bustle of daily life,\n",
            "your sense of self fades away,\n",
            "and you feel connected to a higher reality.\n",
            "For one person I talked to, transcendence came from seeing art.\n",
            "For another person, it was at church.\n",
            "For me, I'm a writer, and it happens through writing.\n",
            "Sometimes I get so in the zone that I lose all sense of time and place.\n",
            "These transcendent experiences can change you.\n",
            "One study had students look up at 200-feet-tall eucalyptus trees\n",
            "for one minute.\n",
            "But afterwards they felt less self-centered,\n",
            "and they even behaved more generously\n",
            "when given the chance to help someone.\n",
            "Belonging, purpose, transcendence.\n",
            "Now, the fourth pillar of meaning, I've found,\n",
            "tends to surprise people.\n",
            "The fourth pillar is storytelling,\n",
            "the story you tell yourself about yourself.\n",
            "Creating a narrative from the events of your life brings clarity.\n",
            "It helps you understand how you became you.\n",
            "But we don't always realize that we're the authors of our stories\n",
            "and can change the way we're telling them.\n",
            "Your life isn't just a list of events.\n",
            "You can edit, interpret and retell your story,\n",
            "even as you're constrained by the facts.\n",
            "I met a young man named Emeka, who'd been paralyzed playing football.\n",
            "After his injury, Emeka told himself,\n",
            "\"My life was great playing football,\n",
            "but now look at me.\"\n",
            "People who tell stories like this --\n",
            "\"My life was good. Now it's bad.\" --\n",
            "tend to be more anxious and depressed.\n",
            "And that was Emeka for a while.\n",
            "But with time, he started to weave a different story.\n",
            "His new story was,\n",
            "\"Before my injury, my life was purposeless.\n",
            "I partied a lot and was a pretty selfish guy.\n",
            "But my injury made me realize I could be a better man.\"\n",
            "That edit to his story changed Emeka's life.\n",
            "After telling the new story to himself,\n",
            "Emeka started mentoring kids,\n",
            "and he discovered what his purpose was:\n",
            "serving others.\n",
            "The psychologist Dan McAdams calls this a \"redemptive story,\"\n",
            "where the bad is redeemed by the good.\n",
            "People leading meaningful lives, he's found,\n",
            "tend to tell stories about their lives\n",
            "defined by redemption, growth and love.\n",
            "But what makes people change their stories?\n",
            "Some people get help from a therapist,\n",
            "but you can do it on your own, too,\n",
            "just by reflecting on your life thoughtfully,\n",
            "how your defining experiences shaped you,\n",
            "what you lost, what you gained.\n",
            "That's what Emeka did.\n",
            "You won't change your story overnight;\n",
            "it could take years and be painful.\n",
            "After all, we've all suffered, and we all struggle.\n",
            "But embracing those painful memories can lead to new insights and wisdom,\n",
            "to finding that good that sustains you.\n",
            "Belonging, purpose, transcendence, storytelling:\n",
            "those are the four pillars of meaning.\n",
            "When I was younger,\n",
            "I was lucky enough to be surrounded by all of the pillars.\n",
            "My parents ran a Sufi meetinghouse from our home in Montreal.\n",
            "Sufism is a spiritual practice associated with the whirling dervishes\n",
            "and the poet Rumi.\n",
            "Twice a week, Sufis would come to our home\n",
            "to meditate, drink Persian tea, and share stories.\n",
            "Their practice also involved serving all of creation\n",
            "through small acts of love,\n",
            "which meant being kind even when people wronged you.\n",
            "But it gave them a purpose: to rein in the ego.\n",
            "Eventually, I left home for college\n",
            "and without the daily grounding of Sufism in my life,\n",
            "I felt unmoored.\n",
            "And I started searching for those things that make life worth living.\n",
            "That's what set me on this journey.\n",
            "Looking back, I now realize\n",
            "that the Sufi house had a real culture of meaning.\n",
            "The pillars were part of the architecture,\n",
            "and the presence of the pillars helped us all live more deeply.\n",
            "Of course, the same principle applies\n",
            "in other strong communities as well --\n",
            "good ones and bad ones.\n",
            "Gangs, cults:\n",
            "these are cultures of meaning that use the pillars\n",
            "and give people something to live and die for.\n",
            "But that's exactly why we as a society\n",
            "must offer better alternatives.\n",
            "We need to build these pillars within our families and our institutions\n",
            "to help people become their best selves.\n",

            "It's an ongoing process.\n",
            "As each day goes by, we're constantly creating our lives,\n",
            "adding to our story.\n",
            "And sometimes we can get off track.\n",

            "When he went under anesthesia for emergency surgery,\n",
            "instead of counting backwards from 10,\n",
            "he repeated our names like a mantra.\n",
            "He wanted our names to be the last words he spoke on earth\n",

            "To do this, we're going to need three technologies to be good enough,\n",
            "and none of them are there yet.\n",
            "First, we're going to need lots of cheap, fast, parallel computers.\n",
            "Second, we're going to need to scan individual human brains\n",
            "in fine spatial and chemical detail,\n",
            "to see exactly what cells are where, connected to what, of what type.\n",
            "And third, we're going to need computer models\n",
            "of how each kind of brain cell works --\n",
            "taking input signals, changing interval state\n",
            "and sending output signals.\n",
            "If we have good enough models of all the kinds of brain cells\n",
            "and a good enough model of the brain,\n",
            "we can put it together to make a good enough model of an entire brain,\n",
            "and that model would have the same input-output behavior as the original.\n",
            "So if you talk to it, it might talk back.\n",
            "If you ask it to do things, it might do them.\n",
            "And if we could do that, everything would change.\n",
            "People have been talking about this idea for decades,\n",
            "under the name of \"uploads.\"\n",
            "I'm going to call them \"ems.\"\n",
            "When they talk about it, they say,\n",
            "\"Is this even possible?\n",
            "If you made one, would it be conscious? Or is it just an empty machine?\n",
            "If you made one of me, is that me or someone else?\"\n",
            "These are all fascinating questions that I'm going to ignore ...\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "because I see a neglected question:\n",
            "What would actually happen?\n",
            "I became obsessed with this question.\n",
            "I spent four years trying to analyze it,\n",
            "using standard academic tools, to guess what would happen,\n",
            "and I'm here to tell you what I found.\n",
            "But be warned --\n",
            "I'm not offering inspiration, I'm offering analysis.\n",
            "I see my job as telling you what's most likely to happen\n",
            "if we did the least to avoid it.\n",
            "If you aren't at least a bit disturbed by something I tell you here,\n",
            "you're just not paying attention.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "OK, the first thing I can tell you\n",
            "is that ems spend most of their life in virtual reality.\n",
            "This is what you might look like if you were using virtual reality.\n",
            "And this is what you might see:\n",
            "sunlight glinting off of water, you might hear gulls flying above,\n",
            "you might even feel the wind on your cheeks or smell seawater,\n",
            "with advanced hardware.\n",
            "Now, if you were to spend a lot of time here,\n",
            "you might want a dashboard\n",
            "where you could do things like make a phone call,\n",
            "move to a new virtual world,\n",
            "check your bank account.\n",
            "Now, while this is what you would look like in virtual reality,\n",
            "this is what an em would look like in virtual reality.\n",
            "It's computer hardware sitting in a server rack somewhere.\n",
            "But still, it could see and experience the same thing.\n",
            "But some things are different for ems.\n",
            "First, while you'll probably always notice that virtual reality isn't entirely real,\n",
            "to an em, it can feel as real to them as this room feels to you now\n",
            "or as anything ever feels.\n",
            "And ems also have some more action possibilities.\n",
            "For example, your mind just always runs at the same speed,\n",
            "but an em can add more or less computer hardware to run faster or slower,\n",
            "and therefore, if the world around them seems to be going too fast,\n",
            "they can just speed up their mind,\n",
            "and the world around them would seem to slow down.\n",
            "In addition, an em can make a copy of itself at that moment.\n",
            "This copy would remember everything the same,\n",
            "and if it starts out with the same speed, looking at the same speed,\n",
            "it might even need to be told, \"You are the copy.\"\n",
            "And em could make archive copies,\n",
            "and with enough archives,\n",
            "an em can be immortal --\n",
            "in principle, though not usually in practice.\n",
            "And an em can move its brain, the computer that represents its brain,\n",
            "from one physical location to another.\n",
            "Ems can actually move around the world at the speed of light,\n",
            "and by moving to a new location,\n",
            "they can interact more quickly with ems near that new location.\n",
            "So far, I've been talking about what ems can do.\n",
            "What do ems choose to do?\n",
            "To understand that, we'll need to understand three key facts.\n",
            "First, ems by definition do what the human they emulate would do\n",
            "in the same situation.\n",
            "So their lives and behavior are very human.\n",
            "They're mainly different because they're living in a different world.\n",
            "Second, ems need real resources to survive.\n",
            "You need food and shelter or you'll die.\n",
            "Also, ems need computer hardware, energy, cooling, or they can't exist.\n",
            "For every subjective minute that an em experiences,\n",
            "someone, usually that em, had to work to pay for it.\n",
            "Third, ems are poor.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "The em population can grow quicker than the em economy,\n",
            "so that means wages fall down to em subsistence levels.\n",
            "That means ems have to be working most of the time.\n",
            "So that means this is what ems usually see:\n",
            "beautiful and luxurious, but desks --\n",
            "they're working most of the time.\n",
            "Now, a subsistence wage scenario, you might think, is exotic and strange,\n",
            "but it's actually the usual case in human history,\n",
            "and it's how pretty much all wild animals have ever lived,\n",
            "so we know what humans do in this situation.\n",
            "Humans basically do what it takes to survive,\n",
            "and this is what lets me say so much about the em world.\n",
            "When creatures are rich, like you,\n",
            "you have to know a lot about what they want\n",
            "to figure out what they do.\n",
            "When creatures are poor,\n",
            "you know that they mostly do what it takes to survive.\n",
            "So we've been talking about the em world from the point of view of the ems --\n",
            "now, let's step back and look at their whole world.\n",
            "First, the em world grows much faster than ours,\n",
            "roughly a hundred times faster.\n",
            "So the amount of change we would experience in a century or two,\n",
            "they would experience in a year or two.\n",
            "And I'm not really willing to project this age much beyond that,\n",
            "because plausibly by then something else will happen, I don't know what.\n",
            "Second, the typical emulation runs even faster,\n",
            "roughly a thousand times human speed.\n",
            "So for them, they experience thousands of years in this year or two,\n",
            "and for them, the world around them is actually changing more slowly\n",
            "than your world seems to change for you.\n",
            "Third, ems are crammed together in a small number of very dense cities.\n",
            "This is not only how they see themselves in virtual reality,\n",
            "it's also how they actually are physically crammed together.\n",
            "So at em speeds, physical travel feels really painfully slow,\n",
            "so most em cities are self-sufficient,\n",
            "most war is cyber war,\n",
            "and most of the rest of the earth away from the em cities\n",
            "is left to the humans, because the ems really aren't that interested in it.\n",
            "Speaking of humans,\n",
            "you were wanting to hear about that.\n",
            "Humans must retire, at once, for good.\n",
            "They just can't compete.\n",
            "Now, humans start out owning all of the capital in this world.\n",
            "The economy grows very fast, their wealth grows very fast.\n",
            "Humans get rich, collectively.\n",
            "As you may know, most humans today don't actually own that much\n",
            "besides their ability to work,\n",
            "so between now and then, they need to acquire sufficient assets,\n",
            "insurance or sharing arrangements,\n",
            "or they may starve.\n",
            "I highly recommend avoiding this outcome.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Now, you might wonder,\n",
            "why would ems let humans exist?\n",
            "Why not kill them, take their stuff?\n",
            "But notice we have many unproductive retirees around us today,\n",
            "and we don't kill them and take their stuff.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "In part, that's because it would disrupt the institutions we share with them.\n",
            "Other groups would wonder who's next,\n",
            "so plausibly, ems may well let humans retire in peace during the age of em.\n",
            "You should worry more that the age of em only lasts a year or two\n",
            "and you don't know what happens next.\n",
            "Ems are very much like humans,\n",
            "but they are not like the typical human.\n",
            "The typical em is a copy of the few hundred most productive humans.\n",
            "So in fact, they are as elite, compared to the typical human,\n",
            "as the typical billionaire, Nobel Prize winner,\n",
            "Olympic gold medalist, head of state.\n",
            "Ems look on humans perhaps with nostalgia and gratitude,\n",
            "but not so much respect,\n",
            "which is, if you think about it, how you think about your ancestors.\n",
            "We know many things about how humans differ in terms of productivity.\n",
            "We can just use those to predict features of ems --\n",
            "for example, they tend to be smart, conscientious, hard-working,\n",
            "married, religious, middle-aged.\n",
            "These are features of ems.\n",
            "Em world also contains enormous variety.\n",
            "Not only does it continue on with most of the kinds of variety that humans do,\n",
            "including variety of industry and profession,\n",
            "they also have many new kinds of variety,\n",
            "and one of the most important is mind speed.\n",
            "Ems can plausibly go from human speed\n",
            "up to a million times faster than human speed,\n",
            "and down to a billion times slower than human speed.\n",
            "Faster ems tend to have markers of high status.\n",
            "They embody more wealth. They win arguments.\n",
            "They sit at premium locations.\n",
            "Slower ems are mostly retirees,\n",
            "and they are like the ghosts of our literature.\n",
            "If you recall, ghosts are all around us --\n",
            "you can interact with them if you pay the price.\n",
            "But they don't know much, they can't influence much,\n",
            "and they're obsessed with the past, so what's the point?\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Ems also have more variety in the structure of their lives.\n",
            "This is your life: you start and you end, really simple.\n",
            "This is the life of an em,\n",
            "who every day splits off some short-term copies\n",
            "to do short-term tasks and then end.\n",
            "We'll talk more about those short term versions in a moment,\n",
            "but they are much more efficient\n",
            "because they don't have to rest for the next day.\n",
            "This em is more opportunistic.\n",
            "They make more copies of themselves when there's more demand for that.\n",
            "They don't know which way the future's going.\n",
            "This is an em designer,\n",
            "who conceives of a large system\n",
            "and then breaks recursively into copies who elaborate that,\n",
            "so ems can implement larger, more coherent designs.\n",
            "This an emulation plumber\n",
            "who remembers that every day, for the last 20 years,\n",
            "they only ever worked two hours a day, a life of leisure.\n",
            "But what really happened is, every day they had a thousand copies,\n",
            "each of whom did a two-hour plumbing job,\n",
            "and only one of them went on to the next day.\n",
            "Objectively, they're working well over 99 percent of the time.\n",
            "Subjectively, they remember a life of leisure.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "This, again, is you. You start and you end.\n",
            "This could be you if at the start of party,\n",
            "you took a drug that meant you would not remember that party\n",
            "ever after that day.\n",
            "Some people do this, I'm told.\n",
            "Toward the end of the party,\n",
            "will you say to yourself, \"I'm about to die, this is terrible.\n",
            "That person tomorrow isn't me, because they won't remember what I do.\"\n",
            "Or you could say, \"I will go on tomorrow. I just won't remember what I did.\"\n",
            "This is an em who splits off a short-term copy\n",
            "to do a short-term task and then end.\n",
            "They have the same two attitude possibilities.\n",
            "They can say, \"I'm a new short-term creature with a short life. I hate this.\"\n",
            "Or \"I'm a part of a larger creature who won't remember this part.\"\n",
            "I predict they'll have that second attitude,\n",
            "not because it's philosophically correct, but because it helps them get along.\n",
            "Today, if the president says we must invade Iraq,\n",
            "and you say, \"Why?\"\n",

The way we build new cities will be at the heart of so much that matters, from climate change to economic vitality to our very well-being and sense of connectedness.

            "So, let me add to the complexity\n",
            "of the situation we find ourselves in.\n",
            "At the same time that we're solving for climate change,\n",
            "we're going to be building cities for three billion people.\n",
            "That's a doubling of the urban environment.\n",
            "If we don't get that right,\n",
            "I'm not sure all the climate solutions in the world will save mankind,\n",
            "because so much depends on how we shape our cities:\n",
            "not just environmental impacts,\n",
            "but our social well-being,\n",
            "our economic vitality,\n",
            "our sense of community and connectedness.\n",
            "Fundamentally, the way we shape cities is a manifestation\n",
            "of the kind of humanity we bring to bear.\n",
            "And so getting it right is, I think,\n",
            "the order of the day.\n",
            "And to a certain degree, getting it right can help us solve climate change,\n",
            "because in the end,\n",
            "it's our behavior that seems to be driving the problem.\n",
            "The problem isn't free-floating,\n",
            "and it isn't just ExxonMobil and oil companies.\n",
            "It's us; how we live.\n",
            "How we live.\n",
            "There's a villain in this story.\n",
            "It's called sprawl, and I'll be upfront about that.\n",
            "But it's not just the kind of sprawl you think of, or many people think of,\n",
            "as low-density development\n",
            "out at the periphery of the metropolitan area.\n",
            "Actually, I think sprawl can happen anywhere, at any density.\n",
            "The key attribute is that it isolates people.\n",
            "It segregates people into economic enclaves\n",
            "and land-use enclaves.\n",
            "It separates them from nature.\n",
            "It doesn't allow the cross-fertilization,\n",
            "the interaction,\n",
            "that make cities great places\n",
            "and that make society thrive.\n",
            "So the antidote to sprawl is really what we all need to be thinking about,\n",
            "especially when we're taking on this massive construction project.\n",
            "So let me take you through one exercise.\n",
            "We developed the model for the state of California\n",
            "so they could get on with reducing carbon emissions.\n",

            "rather than the old armature of freeways.\n",
            "It's a big paradigm shift,\n",

            "They understand intrinsically\n",
            "what a great city can and should be.\n",
            "The second is that the kind of analysis we can bring to bear now\n",
            "allows people to connect the dots,\n",
            "allows people to shape political coalitions\n",
            "that didn't exist in the past.\n",

            "I won't go through all of them, but I'll give you two examples.\n",
            "One was, I'll go to London, it'll be rainy, I'll get depressed,\n",

            "Number two, I'll miss a letter from the IRS,\n",
            "and I'll get audited\n",
            "or raided or shut down or some such.\n",
            "And then you go to the \"Prevent\" column.\n",
            "In that column, you write down the answer to:\n",

            "and use it for 15 minutes in the morning.\n",
            "I knew that helped stave off depressive episodes.\n",
            "For the IRS bit, I could change the mailing address on file with the IRS\n",

            "instead of to my UPS address.\n",
            "Easy-peasy.\n",
            "Then we go to \"Repair.\"\n",

            "or who could you ask for help?\n",
            "So in the first case, London,\n",
            "well, I could fork over some money, fly to Spain, get some sun --\n",
            "undo the damage, if I got into a funk.\n",
            "In the case of missing a letter from the IRS,\n",
            "I could call a friend who is a lawyer\n",
            "or ask, say, a professor of law\n",

            "who I should talk to, how had people handled this in the past.\n",
            "So one question to keep in mind as you're doing this first page is:\n",
            "Has anyone else in the history of time\n",
            "less intelligent or less driven\n",
            "figured this out?\n",
            "Chances are, the answer is \"Yes.\"\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "The second page is simple:\n",
            "What might be the benefits of an attempt or a partial success?\n",
            "You can see we're playing up the fears\n",
            "and really taking a conservative look at the upside.\n",
            "So if you attempted whatever you're considering,\n",
            "might you build confidence, develop skills,\n",
            "emotionally, financially, otherwise?\n",
            "What might be the benefits of, say, a base hit?\n",
            "Spend 10 to 15 minutes on this.\n",
            "Page three.\n",
            "This might be the most important, so don't skip it:\n",
            "\"The Cost of Inaction.\"\n",
            "Humans are very good at considering what might go wrong\n",
            "if we try something new, say, ask for a raise.\n",

            "not changing anything.\n",
            "So you should ask yourself,\n",
            "if I avoid this action or decision\n",
            "and actions and decisions like it,\n",
            "what might my life look like in, say, six months, 12 months, three years?\n",
            "Any further out, it starts to seem intangible.\n",
            "And really get detailed -- again, emotionally, financially,\n",
            "physically, whatever.\n",
            "And when I did this, it painted a terrifying picture.\n",
            "I was self-medicating,\n",
            "my business was going to implode at any moment at all times,\n",
            "if I didn't step away.\n",
            "My relationships were fraying or failing.\n",
            "And I realized that inaction was no longer an option for me.\n",
            "Those are the three pages. That's it. That's fear-setting.\n",
            "And after this, I realized that on a scale of one to 10,\n",
            "one being minimal impact, 10 being maximal impact,\n",
            "if I took the trip, I was risking\n",
            "a one to three of temporary and reversible pain\n",
            "for an eight to 10 of positive, life-changing impact\n",
            "that could be a semi-permanent.\n",
            "So I took the trip.\n",
            "None of the disasters came to pass.\n",
            "There were some hiccups, sure.\n",
            "I was able to extricate myself from the business.\n",
            "I ended up extending that trip for a year and a half around the world,\n",
            "and that became the basis for my first book,\n",
            "that leads me here today.\n",
            "And I can trace all of my biggest wins\n",
            "and all of my biggest disasters averted\n",
            "back to doing fear-setting\n",
            "at least once a quarter.\n",
            "It's not a panacea.\n",
            "You'll find that some of your fears are very well-founded.\n",

            "But you shouldn't conclude that\n",

            "But in this case, the question was more like,\n",
            "\"Um, are you kidding?\"\n",
            "Because, they said,\n",
            "the premise of all this work\n",
            "was that kids were bored with old libraries, musty old libraries.\n",
            "They were tired of them.\n",
            "And instead, they said, these kids have never really seen a library.\n",
            "The school libraries in these schools\n",
            "are really so dilapidated, if they're there at all,\n",
            "that they haven't bored anyone.\n",
            "They haven't even been there to bore anyone at all.\n",
            "So the idea was, just forget about giving it a new name.\n",
            "Just call it, one last try, a library.\n",
            "Right? OK.\n",
            "So I thought, OK, give it a little oomph?\n",
            "Exclamation point?\n",
            "Then -- this is because I'm clever --\n",
            "move that into the \"i,\"\n",
            "make it red,\n",
            "and there you have it, the Library Initiative.\n",
            "So I thought, mission accomplished, there's your logo.\n",
            "So what's interesting about this logo, an unintended consequence,\n",
            "was that it turned out that they didn't really even need my design\n",
            "because you could type it any font, you could write it by hand,\n",
            "and when they started sending emails around,\n",
            "they just would use Shift and 1,\n",
            "they'd get their own logo just right out of the thing.\n",
            "And I thought, well, that's fine.\n",
            "Feel free to use that logo.\n",
            "And then I embarked on the real rollout of this thing --\n",
            "working with every one of the architects\n",
            "to put this logo on the front door of their own library. Right?\n",
            "So here's the big rollout.\n",
            "Basically I'd work with different architects.\n",
            "First Robin Hood was my client. Now these architects were my client.\n",
            "I'd say, \"Here's your logo. Put it on the door.\"\n",
            "\"Here's your logo. Put it on both doors.\"\n",
            "\"Here's your logo. Put it off to the side.\"\n",
            "\"Here's your logo repeated all over to the top.\"\n",
            "So everything was going swimmingly.\n",
            "I just was saying, \"Here's your logo. Here's your logo.\"\n",
            "Then I got a call from one of the architects,\n",
            "a guy named Richard Lewis, and he says, \"I've got a problem.\n",
            "You're the graphics guy. Can you solve it?\"\n",
            "And I said, OK, sure.\"\n",
            "And he said, \"The problem is that there's a space\n",
            "between the shelf and the ceiling.\"\n",
            "So that sounds like an architectural issue to me,\n",
            "not a graphic design issue, so I'm, \"Go on.\"\n",
            "And Richard says, \"Well, the top shelf has to be low enough\n",
            "for the kid to reach it,\n",
            "but I'm in a big old building, and the ceilings are really high,\n",
            "so actually I've got all this space up there\n",
            "and I need something like a mural.\"\n",
            "And I'm like, \"Whoa, you know, I'm a logo designer.\n",
            "I'm not Diego Rivera or something.\n",
            "I'm not a muralist.\"\n",
            "And so he said, \"But can't you think of anything?\"\n",
            "So I said, \"OK, what if we just took pictures of the kids in the school\n",
            "and just put them around the top of the thing,\n",
            "and maybe that could work.\"\n",
            "And my wife is a photographer,\n",
            "and I said, \"Dorothy, there's no budget,\n",
            "can you come to this school in east New York, take these pictures?\"\n",
            "And she did,\n",
            "and if you go in Richard's library,\n",
            "which is one of the first that opened,\n",
            "it has this glorious frieze of, like, the heroes of the school,\n",
            "oversized, looking down\n",
            "into the little dollhouse of the real library, right?\n",
            "And the kids were great, hand-selected by the principals\n",
            "and the librarian.\n",
            "It just kind of created this heroic atmosphere in this library,\n",
            "this very dignified setting below and the joy of the children above.\n",
            "So naturally all the other librarians in the other schools see this\n",
            "and they said, well, we want murals too.\n",
            "And I'm like, OK.\n",
            "So then I think, well, it can't be the same mural every time,\n",
            "so Dorothy did another one, and then she did another one,\n",
            "but then we needed more help,\n",
            "so I called an illustrator I knew named Lynn Pauley,\n",
            "and Lynn did these beautiful paintings of the kids.\n",
            "Then I called a guy named Charles Wilkin at a place called Automatic Design.\n",
            "He did these amazing collages.\n",
            "We had Rafael Esquer\n",
            "do these great silhouettes.\n",
            "He would work with the kids, asking for words,\n",
            "and then based on those prompts,\n",
            "come up with this little, delirious kind of constellation\n",
            "of silhouettes of things that are in books.\n",
            "Peter Arkle interviewed the kids\n",
            "and had them talk about their favorite books\n",
            "and he put their testimony as a frieze up there.\n",
            "Stefan Sagmeister worked with Yuko Shimizu\n",
            "and they did this amazing manga-style statement,\n",
            "\"Everyone who is honest is interesting,\"\n",
            "that goes all the way around.\n",
            "Christoph Niemann, brilliant illustrator,\n",
            "did a whole series of things\n",
            "where he embedded books into the faces and characters\n",
            "and images and places that you find in the books.\n",
            "And then even Maira Kalman\n",
            "did this amazing cryptic installation of objects and words\n",
            "that kind of go all around and will fascinate students\n",
            "for as long as it's up there.\n",
            "So this was really satisfying,\n",
            "and basically my role here was reading a series of dimensions to these artists,\n",
            "and I would say,\n",
            "\"Three feet by 15 feet, whatever you want.\n",
            "Let me know if you have any problem with that.\"\n",
            "And they would go and install these. It just was the greatest thing.\n",
            "But the greatest thing, actually, was --\n",
            "Every once in a while,\n",
            "I'd get, like, an invitation in the mail made of construction paper,\n",
            "and it would say, \"You are invited to the opening of our new library.\"\n",
            "So you'd go to the library, say, you'd go to PS10,\n",
            "and you'd go inside.\n",
            "There'd be balloons, there'd be a student ambassador,\n",
            "there'd be speeches that were read,\n",
            "poetry that was written specifically for the opening,\n",
            "dignitaries would present people with certificates,\n",
            "and the whole thing was just a delirious, fun party.\n",
            "So I loved going to these things.\n",
            "I would stand there dressed like this, obviously not belonging,\n",
            "and someone would say, \"What are you doing here, mister?\"\n",
            "And I'd say, \"Well, I'm part of the team that designed this place.\"\n",
            "And they'd said, \"You do these shelves?\"\n",
            "And I said, \"No.\" \"You took the pictures up above.\"\n",
            "\"No.\"\n",
            "\"Well, what did you do?\"\n",
            "\"You know when you came in? The sign over the door?\"\n",
            "\"The sign that says library?\"\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "\"Yeah, I did that!\"\n",
            "And then they'd sort of go, \"OK. Nice work if you can get it.\"\n",
            "So it was so satisfying going to these little openings\n",
            "despite the fact that I was kind of largely ignored or humiliated,\n",
            "but it was actually fun going to the openings,\n",
            "so I decided that I wanted to get the people in my office\n",
            "who had worked on these projects, get the illustrators and photographers,\n",
            "and I said, why don't we rent a van\n",
            "and drive around the five boroughs of New York\n",
            "and see how many we could hit at one time.\n",
            "And eventually there were going to be 60 of these libraries,\n",
            "so we probably got to see maybe half a dozen in one long day.\n",
            "And the best thing of all was meeting these librarians\n",
            "who kind of were running these, took possession of these places\n",
            "like their private stage upon which they were invited\n",
            "to mesmerize their students and bring the books to life,\n",
            "and it was just this really exciting experience\n",
            "for all of us to actually see these things in action.\n",
            "So we spent a long day doing this\n",
            "and we were in the very last library.\n",
            "It was still winter, because it got dark early,\n",
            "and the librarian says,\n",
            "\"I'm about to close down. So really nice having you here.\n",
            "Hey, wait a second, do you want to see how I turn off the lights?\"\n",
            "I'm like, \"OK.\"\n",
            "And she said, \"I have this special way that I do it.\"\n",
            "And then she showed me.\n",
            "What she did was she turned out every light one by one by one by one,\n",
            "and the last light she left on\n",
            "was the light that illuminated the kids' faces,\n",
            "and she said, \"That's the last light I turn off every night,\n",
            "because I like to remind myself why I come to work.\"\n",
            "So when I started this whole thing,\n",
            "remember, it was just about designing that logo\n",
            "and being clever, come up with a new name?\n",
            "The unintended consequence here,\n",
            "which I would like to take credit for\n",
            "and like to think I can think through the experience to that extent,\n",
            "but I can't.\n",
            "I was just focused on a foot ahead of me, as far as I could reach with my own hands.\n",
            "Instead, way off in the distance\n",
            "was a librarian\n",
            "who was going to find the chain of consequences\n",
            "that we had set in motion,\n",
            "a source of inspiration\n",
            "so that she in this case could do her work really well.\n",
            "40,000 kids a year are affected by these libraries.\n",
            "They've been happening for more than 10 years now,\n",
            "so those librarians have kind of turned on a generation of children to books\n",
            "and so it's been a thrill to find out\n",

            "Do you ever think about how important the oceans are in our daily lives?\n",
            "The oceans cover two-thirds of our planet.\n",
            "They provide half the oxygen we breathe.\n",
            "They moderate our climate.\n",
            "And they provide jobs and medicine and food\n",
            "including 20 percent of protein to feed the entire world population.\n",
            "People used to think that the oceans were so vast\n",
            "that they wouldn't be affected by human activities.\n",
            "Well today I'm going to tell you about a serious reality\n",
            "that is changing our oceans called ocean acidification,\n",
            "or the evil twin of climate change.\n",
            "Did you know that the oceans have absorbed 25 percent of all of the carbon dioxide\n",
            "that we have emitted to the atmosphere?\n",
            "Now this is just another great service provided by the oceans\n",
            "since carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases\n",
            "that's causing climate change.\n",
            "But as we keep pumping more and more and more\n",
            "carbon dioxide into the atmosphere\n",
            "more is dissolving into the oceans.\n",
            "And this is what's changing our ocean chemistry.\n",
            "When carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater,\n",
            "it undergoes a number of chemical reactions.\n",
            "Now lucky for you,\n",
            "I don't have time to get into the details of the chemistry for today.\n",
            "But I'll tell you as more carbon dioxide enters the ocean,\n",
            "the seawater pH goes down.\n",
            "And this basically means that there is an increase in ocean acidity.\n",
            "And this whole process is called ocean acidification.\n",
            "And it's happening alongside climate change.\n",
            "Scientists have been monitoring ocean acidification for over two decades.\n",
            "This figure is an important time series in Hawaii,\n",
            "and the top line shows steadily increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide,\n",
            "or CO2 gas, in the atmosphere.\n",
            "And this is directly as a result of human activities.\n",
            "The line underneath shows the increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide\n",
            "that is dissolved in the surface of the ocean\n",
            "which you can see is increasing at the same rate\n",
            "as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since measurements began.\n",
            "The line on the bottom shows then shows the change in chemistry.\n",
            "As more carbon dioxide has entered the ocean,\n",
            "the seawater pH has gone down,\n",
            "which basically means there has been an increase in ocean acidity.\n",
            "Now in Ireland, scientists are also monitoring ocean acidification --\n",
            "scientists at the Marine Institute and NUI Galway.\n",
            "And we, too, are seeing acidification at the same rate\n",
            "as these main ocean time-series sites around the world.\n",
            "So it's happening right at our doorstep.\n",
            "Now I'd like to give you an example of just how we collect our data\n",
            "to monitor a changing ocean.\n",
            "Firstly we collect a lot of our samples in the middle of winter.\n",
            "So as you can imagine, in the North Atlantic\n",
            "we get hit with some seriously stormy conditions --\n",
            "so not for any of you who get a little motion sickness,\n",
            "but we are collecting some very valuable data.\n",
            "So we lower this instrument over the side of the ship,\n",
            "and there are sensors that are mounted on the bottom\n",
            "that can tell us information about the surrounding water,\n",
            "such as temperature or dissolved oxygen.\n",
            "And then we can collect our seawater samples in these large bottles.\n",
            "So we start at the bottom, which can be over four kilometers deep\n",
            "just off our continental shelf,\n",
            "and we take samples at regular intervals right up to the surface.\n",
            "We take the seawater back on the deck,\n",
            "and then we can either analyze them on the ship\n",
            "or back in the laboratory for the different chemicals parameters.\n",
            "But why should we care?\n",
            "How is ocean acidification going to affect all of us?\n",
            "Well, here are the worrying facts.\n",
            "There has already been an increase in ocean acidity of 26 percent\n",
            "since pre-industrial times, which is directly due to human activities.\n",
            "Unless we can start slowing down our carbon dioxide emissions,\n",
            "we're expecting an increase in ocean acidity of 170 percent\n",
            "by the end of this century.\n",
            "I mean this is within our children's lifetime.\n",
            "This rate of acidification is 10 times faster\n",
            "than any acidification in our oceans for over 55 million years.\n",
            "So our marine life have never, ever experienced\n",
            "such a fast rate of change before.\n",
            "So we literally could not know how they're going to cope.\n",
            "Now there was a natural acidification event millions of years ago,\n",
            "which was much slower than what we're seeing today.\n",
            "And this coincided with a mass extinction of many marine species.\n",
            "So is that what we're headed for?\n",
            "Well, maybe.\n",
            "Studies are showing some species are actually doing quite well\n",
            "but many are showing a negative response.\n",
            "One of the big concerns is as ocean acidity increases,\n",
            "the concentration of carbonate ions in seawater decrease.\n",
            "Now these ions are basically the building blocks\n",
            "for many marine species to make their shells,\n",
            "for example crabs or mussels, oysters.\n",
            "Another example are corals.\n",
            "They also need these carbonate ions in seawater\n",
            "to make their coral structure in order to build coral reefs.\n",
            "As ocean acidity increases\n",
            "and the concentration of carbonate ions decrease,\n",
            "these species first find it more difficult to make their shells.\n",
            "And at even even lower levels, they can actually begin to dissolve.\n",
            "This here is a pteropod, it's called a sea butterfly.\n",
            "And it's an important food source in the ocean for many species,\n",

            "I was in Madrid one night in 2002\n",
            "with my teacher and friend Joaquín Sabina,\n",
            "when he said he had something to give me.\n",
            "He said,\n",
            "\"Jorge, I have some lines that you need to put into a song.\n",
            "Take these down, take these down.\"\n",
            "I looked on the table but all I found was a circular coaster,\n",
            "on which I wrote the lines my teacher dictated.\n",
            "They were four lines that went like this:\n",
            "\"I am a Jewish Moor living among Christians\n",
            "I don't know who my God is, nor who my brothers are.\"\n",
            "Those lines really made an impression on me.\n",
            "I said, \"What beautiful lyrics, Joaquín. Did you write them?\"\n",
            "He said no, they were by another composer named Chicho Sánchez Ferlosio,\n",
            "who was less known than Joaquín, but also a great poet.\n",
            "These lines came to me at a time\n",
            "where I had been wanting to express something for a while,\n",
            "but didn't quite know how.\n",
            "I was getting up to leave and go home to write,\n",
            "when Joaquín stopped me and said, \"Hang on, hang on,\"\n",
            "and presented me with this challenge:\n",
            "\"Write the stanzas for this song\n",
            "in Décimas.\"\n",
            "Now, at this point in my life,\n",
            "I still wasn't completely sure what Décimas were,\n",
            "but I was too embarrassed to tell my teacher I didn't know.\n",
            "So I put on my best \"Yeah, I totally understand\" face,\n",
            "and went home to look up what Décimas were.\n",
            "I learned that a Décima is a type of verse\n",
            "that only exists in Spanish,\n",
            "and that it has 10 lines.\n",
            "It's very, very complex --\n",
            "perhaps the most complex style of stanza that we have in Spanish.\n",
            "It also has a very concrete date of origin,\n",
            "which is very rare for a style of stanza.\n",
            "The Décima was invented in Spain in 1591,\n",
            "by a guy named Vicente Espinel, a musician and poet from Málaga.\n",
            "And listen to this coincidence: he was the same guy\n",
            "who added the sixth string\n",
            "to what would later be called the Spanish guitar.\n",
            "This string right here --\n",
            "it's called the \"bordona.\"\n",
            "From Spain, the Décima, with its 10 lines,\n",
            "crosses over to America, just like the Spanish guitar,\n",
            "but in contrast to the Décima,\n",
            "the Spanish guitar continues to live today\n",
            "on both sides of the Atlantic.\n",
            "But the Décima, in Spain, its birthplace,\n",
            "disappeared; it died out.\n",
            "It died out about 200 years ago,\n",
            "and yet in Latin America, from Mexico to Chile,\n",
            "all our countries maintain some form of the Décima\n",
            "in our popular traditions.\n",
            "In each place, they've given it a different name,\n",
            "and set it to different music.\n",
            "It has a lot of different names -- more than 20 in total on the continent.\n",
            "In Mexico, for example, it's called the \"Son Jarocho,\"\n",

            "It's also got a really surprising feature,\n",
            "which is that despite the fact that it developed independently\n",
            "in each of the different countries,\n",
            "it maintains even today, 400 years after its creation,\n",
            "exactly the same rhyme, syllable and line structure --\n",
            "the same structure Vicente Espinel gave it during the Spanish Baroque period.\n",
            "Here's the structure --\n",
            "I'll give you the basic idea and then later you can look online\n",
            "and learn more about it.\n",
            "The Décima is ten lines long; each line has eight syllables.\n",

            "for more than four centuries.\n",
            "It's not that complicated, because it has an impressive musicality to it,\n",
            "a type of musicality\n",
            "that's very hard to describe technically.\n",
            "I prefer that you listen to it.\n",

            "Chris Anderson: Elon, hey, welcome back to TED. It's great to have you here. Elon Musk: Thanks for having me.\n",
            "CA: So, in the next half hour or so, we're going to spend some time exploring your vision for what an exciting future might look like,\n",
            "which I guess makes the first question a little ironic: Why are you boring?\n",
            "EM: Yeah. I ask myself that frequently.\n",
            "We're trying to dig a hole under LA, and this is to create the beginning\n",
            "of what will hopefully be a 3D network of tunnels to alleviate congestion.\n",
            "So right now, one of the most soul-destroying things is traffic.\n",
            "It affects people in every part of the world. It takes away so much of your life.\n",
            "It's horrible. It's particularly horrible in LA. (Laughter)\n",
            "CA: I think you've brought with you the first visualization that's been shown of this. Can I show this?\n",
            "EM: Yeah, absolutely. So this is the first time -- Just to show what we're talking about. So a couple of key things that are important\n",
            "in having a 3D tunnel network. First of all, you have to be able\n",
            "to integrate the entrance and exit of the tunnel seamlessly into the fabric of the city. So by having an elevator,\n",
            "sort of a car skate, that's on an elevator, you can integrate the entrance and exits to the tunnel network\n",
            "just by using two parking spaces. And then the car gets on a skate.\n",
            "There's no speed limit here, so we're designing this to be able to operate at 200 kilometers an hour.\n",
            "CA: How much? EM: 200 kilometers an hour, or about 130 miles per hour.\n",
            "So you should be able to get from, say, Westwood to LAX\n",
            "in six minutes -- five, six minutes. (Applause)\n",
            "CA: So possibly, initially done, it's like on a sort of toll road-type basis. EM: Yeah.\n",
            "CA: Which, I guess, alleviates some traffic from the surface streets as well. EM: So, I don't know if people noticed it in the video,\n",
            "but there's no real limit to how many levels of tunnel you can have.\n",
            "You can go much further deep than you can go up. The deepest mines are much deeper than the tallest buildings are tall,\n",
            "so you can alleviate any arbitrary level of urban congestion\n",
            "with a 3D tunnel network. This is a very important point. So a key rebuttal to the tunnels is that if you add one layer of tunnels,\n",
            "that will simply alleviate congestion, it will get used up, and then you'll be back where you started, back with congestion.\n",
            "But you can go to any arbitrary number of tunnels, any number of levels. CA: But people -- seen traditionally, it's incredibly expensive to dig,\n",
            "and that would block this idea. EM: Yeah. Well, they're right. To give you an example, the LA subway extension,\n",
            "which is -- I think it's a two-and-a-half mile extension that was just completed for two billion dollars.\n",
            "So it's roughly a billion dollars a mile to do the subway extension in LA.\n",
            "And this is not the highest utility subway in the world. So yeah, it's quite difficult to dig tunnels normally.\n",
            "I think we need to have at least a tenfold improvement in the cost per mile of tunneling.\n",
            "CA: And how could you achieve that? EM: Actually, if you just do two things,\n",
            "you can get to approximately an order of magnitude improvement, and I think you can go beyond that.\n",
            "So the first thing to do is to cut the tunnel diameter by a factor of two or more.\n",
            "So a single road lane tunnel according to regulations has to be 26 feet, maybe 28 feet in diameter\n",
            "to allow for crashes and emergency vehicles and sufficient ventilation for combustion engine cars.\n",
            "But if you shrink that diameter to what we're attempting, which is 12 feet, which is plenty to get an electric skate through,\n",
            "you drop the diameter by a factor of two and the cross-sectional area by a factor of four,\n",
            "and the tunneling cost scales with the cross-sectional area. So that's roughly a half-order of magnitude improvement right there.\n",
            "Then tunneling machines currently tunnel for half the time, then they stop, and then the rest of the time is putting in reinforcements\n",
            "for the tunnel wall. So if you design the machine instead to do continuous tunneling and reinforcing,\n",
            "that will give you a factor of two improvement. Combine that and that's a factor of eight. Also these machines are far from being at their power or thermal limits,\n",
            "so you can jack up the power to the machine substantially. I think you can get at least a factor of two,\n",
            "maybe a factor of four or five improvement on top of that. So I think there's a fairly straightforward series of steps\n",
            "to get somewhere in excess of an order of magnitude improvement in the cost per mile, and our target actually is --\n",
            "we've got a pet snail called Gary, this is from Gary the snail from \"South Park,\"\n",
            "I mean, sorry, \"SpongeBob SquarePants.\" (Laughter) So Gary is capable of --\n",
            "currently he's capable of going 14 times faster than a tunnel-boring machine.\n",
            "(Laughter) CA: You want to beat Gary. EM: We want to beat Gary.\n",
            "(Laughter) He's not a patient little fellow, and that will be victory.\n",
            "Victory is beating the snail. CA: But a lot of people imagining, dreaming about future cities,\n",
            "they imagine that actually the solution is flying cars, drones, etc. You go aboveground.\n",
            "Why isn't that a better solution? You save all that tunneling cost. EM: Right. I'm in favor of flying things.\n",
            "Obviously, I do rockets, so I like things that fly. This is not some inherent bias against flying things,\n",
            "but there is a challenge with flying cars in that they'll be quite noisy,\n",
            "the wind force generated will be very high.\n",
            "Let's just say that if something's flying over your head, a whole bunch of flying cars going all over the place,\n",
            "that is not an anxiety-reducing situation. (Laughter)\n",
            "You don't think to yourself, \"Well, I feel better about today.\"\n",
            "You're thinking, \"Did they service their hubcap, or is it going to come off and guillotine me?\"\n",
            "Things like that. CA: So you've got this vision\n",
            "of future cities with these rich, 3D networks of tunnels underneath.\n",
            "Is there a tie-in here with Hyperloop? Could you apply these tunnels to use for this Hyperloop idea\n",
            "you released a few years ago. EM: Yeah, so we've been sort of puttering around\n",
            "with the Hyperloop stuff for a while. We built a Hyperloop test track adjacent to SpaceX,\n",
            "just for a student competition, to encourage innovative ideas in transport.\n",
            "And it actually ends up being the biggest vacuum chamber in the world\n",
            "after the Large Hadron Collider, by volume.\n",
            "So it was quite fun to do that, but it was kind of a hobby thing,\n",
            "and then we think we might -- so we've built a little pusher car to push the student pods,\n",
            "but we're going to try seeing how fast we can make the pusher go if it's not pushing something.\n",
            "So we're cautiously optimistic we'll be able to be faster than the world's fastest bullet train\n",
            "even in a .8-mile stretch. CA: Whoa. Good brakes. EM: Yeah, I mean, it's -- yeah.\n",
            "It's either going to smash into tiny pieces or go quite fast. CA: But you can picture, then, a Hyperloop in a tunnel\n",
            "running quite long distances. EM: Exactly. And looking at tunneling technology,\n",
            "it turns out that in order to make a tunnel, you have to --\n",
            "In order to seal against the water table, you've got to typically design a tunnel wall to be good\n",
            "to about five or six atmospheres. So to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere,\n",
            "or near-vacuum. So actually, it sort of turns out that automatically,\n",
            "if you build a tunnel that is good enough to resist the water table, it is automatically capable of holding vacuum.\n",
            "CA: Huh. EM: So, yeah. CA: And so you could actually picture,\n",
            "what kind of length tunnel is in Elon's future to running Hyperloop?\n",
            "EM: I think there's no real length limit. You could dig as much as you want.\n",
            "I think if you were to do something like a DC-to-New York Hyperloop,\n",
            "I think you'd probably want to go underground the entire way because it's a high-density area. You're going under a lot of buildings and houses,\n",
            "and if you go deep enough, you cannot detect the tunnel. Sometimes people think, well, it's going to be pretty annoying\n",
            "to have a tunnel dug under my house. Like, if that tunnel is dug more than about three or four tunnel diameters beneath your house,\n",
            "you will not be able to detect it being dug at all. In fact, if you're able to detect the tunnel being dug,\n",
            "whatever device you are using, you can get a lot of money for that device from the Israeli military, who is trying to detect tunnels from Hamas,\n",
            "and from the US Customs and Border patrol that try and detect drug tunnels. So the reality is\n",
            "that earth is incredibly good at absorbing vibrations, and once the tunnel depth is below a certain level,\n",
            "it is undetectable. Maybe if you have a very sensitive seismic instrument, you might be able to detect it.\n",
            "CA: So you've started a new company to do this called The Boring Company. Very nice. Very funny.\n",
            "(Laughter) EM: What's funny about that? (Laughter)\n",
            "CA: How much of your time is this? EM: It's maybe ...\n",
            "two or three percent. CA: You've called it a hobby. This is what an Elon Musk hobby looks like.\n",
            "(Laughter) EM: I mean, it really is, like -- This is basically interns and people doing it part time.\n",
            "We bought some second-hand machinery. It's kind of puttering along, but it's making good progress, so --\n",
            "CA: So an even bigger part of your time is being spent on electrifying cars and transport through Tesla.\n",
            "Is one of the motivations for the tunneling project the realization that actually,\n",
            "in a world where cars are electric and where they're self-driving, there may end up being more cars on the roads\n",
            "on any given hour than there are now? EM: Yeah, exactly.\n",
            "A lot of people think that when you make cars autonomous, they'll be able to go faster and that will alleviate congestion.\n",
            "And to some degree that will be true, but once you have shared autonomy where it's much cheaper to go by car\n",
            "and you can go point to point, the affordability of going in a car will be better than that of a bus.\n",
            "Like, it will cost less than a bus ticket. So the amount of driving that will occur will be much greater with shared autonomy,\n",
            "and actually traffic will get far worse. CA: You started Tesla with the goal of persuading the world\n",
            "that electrification was the future of cars, and a few years ago, people were laughing at you.\n",
            "Now, not so much. EM: OK. (Laughter)\n",
            "I don't know. I don't know. CA: But isn't it true that pretty much every auto manufacturer\n",
            "has announced serious electrification plans for the short- to medium-term future?\n",
            "EM: Yeah. Yeah. I think almost every automaker has some electric vehicle program.\n",
            "They vary in seriousness. Some are very serious about transitioning entirely to electric,\n",
            "and some are just dabbling in it. And some, amazingly, are still pursuing fuel cells,\n",
            "but I think that won't last much longer. CA: But isn't there a sense, though, Elon, where you can now just declare victory and say, you know, \"We did it.\"\n",
            "Let the world electrify, and you go on and focus on other stuff?\n",
            "EM: Yeah. I intend to stay with Tesla as far into the future as I can imagine,\n",
            "and there are a lot of exciting things that we have coming. Obviously the Model 3 is coming soon.\n",
            "We'll be unveiling the Tesla Semi truck. CA: OK, we're going to come to this.\n",
            "So Model 3, it's supposed to be coming in July-ish. EM: Yeah, it's looking quite good for starting production in July.\n",
            "CA: Wow. One of the things that people are so excited about is the fact that it's got autopilot.\n",
            "And you put out this video a while back showing what that technology would look like.\n",
            "EM: Yeah. CA: There's obviously autopilot in Model S right now. What are we seeing here?\n",
            "EM: Yeah, so this is using only cameras and GPS.\n",
            "So there's no LIDAR or radar being used here. This is just using passive optical, which is essentially what a person uses.\n",
            "The whole road system is meant to be navigated with passive optical, or cameras,\n",
            "and so once you solve cameras or vision,\n",
            "then autonomy is solved. If you don't solve vision, it's not solved. So that's why our focus is so heavily on having a vision neural net\n",
            "that's very effective for road conditions. CA: Right. Many other people are going the LIDAR route.\n",
            "You want cameras plus radar is most of it. EM: You can absolutely be superhuman with just cameras.\n",
            "Like, you can probably do it ten times better than humans would, just cameras. CA: So the new cars being sold right now have eight cameras in them.\n",
            "They can't yet do what that showed. When will they be able to?\n",
            "EM: I think we're still on track for being able to go cross-country\n",
            "from LA to New York by the end of the year, fully autonomous. CA: OK, so by the end of the year, you're saying,\n",
            "someone's going to sit in a Tesla without touching the steering wheel, tap in \"New York,\" off it goes.\n",
            "EM: Yeah. CA: Won't ever have to touch the wheel -- by the end of 2017.\n",
            "EM: Yeah. Essentially, November or December of this year, we should be able to go all the way from a parking lot in California\n",
            "to a parking lot in New York, no controls touched at any point during the entire journey.\n",
            "(Applause) CA: Amazing. But part of that is possible because you've already got a fleet of Teslas driving all these roads.\n",
            "You're accumulating a huge amount of data of that national road system.\n",
            "EM: Yes, but the thing that will be interesting is that I'm actually fairly confident it will be able to do that route\n",
            "even if you change the route dynamically. So, it's fairly easy --\n",
            "If you say I'm going to be really good at one specific route, that's one thing, but it should be able to go, really be very good,\n",
            "certainly once you enter a highway, to go anywhere on the highway system in a given country.\n",
            "So it's not sort of limited to LA to New York. We could change it and make it Seattle-Florida,\n",
            "that day, in real time. So you were going from LA to New York. Now go from LA to Toronto.\n",
            "CA: So leaving aside regulation for a second, in terms of the technology alone,\n",
            "the time when someone will be able to buy one of your cars and literally just take the hands off the wheel and go to sleep\n",
            "and wake up and find that they've arrived, how far away is that, to do that safely? EM: I think that's about two years.\n",
            "So the real trick of it is not how do you make it work say 99.9 percent of the time,\n",
            "because, like, if a car crashes one in a thousand times, then you're probably still not going to be comfortable falling asleep.\n",
            "You shouldn't be, certainly. (Laughter) It's never going to be perfect.\n",
            "No system is going to be perfect, but if you say it's perhaps --\n",
            "the car is unlikely to crash in a hundred lifetimes, or a thousand lifetimes,\n",
            "then people are like, OK, wow, if I were to live a thousand lives, I would still most likely never experience a crash,\n",
            "then that's probably OK. CA: To sleep. I guess the big concern of yours is that people may actually\n",
            "get seduced too early to think that this is safe, and that you'll have some horrible incident happen that puts things back.\n",
            "EM: Well, I think that the autonomy system is likely to at least mitigate the crash,\n",
            "except in rare circumstances. The thing to appreciate about vehicle safety\n",
            "is this is probabilistic. I mean, there's some chance that any time a human driver gets in a car,\n",
            "that they will have an accident that is their fault. It's never zero.\n",
            "So really the key threshold for autonomy is how much better does autonomy need to be than a person\n",
            "before you can rely on it? CA: But once you get literally safe hands-off driving, the power to disrupt the whole industry seems massive,\n",
            "because at that point you've spoken of people being able to buy a car, drops you off at work, and then you let it go\n",
            "and provide a sort of Uber-like service to other people, earn you money,\n",
            "maybe even cover the cost of your lease of that car, so you can kind of get a car for free. Is that really likely?\n",
            "EM: Yeah. Absolutely this is what will happen. So there will be a shared autonomy fleet where you buy your car\n",
            "and you can choose to use that car exclusively, you could choose to have it be used only by friends and family,\n",
            "only by other drivers who are rated five star,\n",
            "you can choose to share it sometimes but not other times.\n",
            "That's 100 percent what will occur. It's just a question of when.\n",
            "CA: Wow. So you mentioned the Semi and I think you're planning to announce this in September,\n",
            "but I'm curious whether there's anything you could show us today? EM: I will show you a teaser shot of the truck.\n",
            "(Laughter) It's alive. CA: OK.\n",
            "EM: That's definitely a case where we want to be cautious about the autonomy features.\n",
            "Yeah. (Laughter) CA: We can't see that much of it, but it doesn't look like just a little friendly neighborhood truck.\n",
            "It looks kind of badass. What sort of semi is this?\n",
            "EM: So this is a heavy duty, long-range semitruck. So it's the highest weight capability\n",
            "and with long range. So essentially it's meant to alleviate the heavy-duty trucking loads.\n",
            "And this is something which people do not today think is possible.\n",
            "They think the truck doesn't have enough power or it doesn't have enough range, and then with the Tesla Semi\n",
            "we want to show that no, an electric truck actually can out-torque any diesel semi.\n",
            "And if you had a tug-of-war competition, the Tesla Semi will tug the diesel semi uphill.\n",
            "(Laughter) (Applause) CA: That's pretty cool. And short term, these aren't driverless.\n",
            "These are going to be trucks that truck drivers want to drive. EM: Yes. So what will be really fun about this\n",
            "is you have a flat torque RPM curve with an electric motor,\n",
            "whereas with a diesel motor or any kind of internal combustion engine car, you've got a torque RPM curve that looks like a hill.\n",
            "So this will be a very spry truck. You can drive this around like a sports car.\n",
            "There's no gears. It's, like, single speed. CA: There's a great movie to be made here somewhere. I don't know what it is and I don't know that it ends well,\n",
            "but it's a great movie. (Laughter) EM: It's quite bizarre test-driving.\n",
            "When I was driving the test prototype for the first truck. It's really weird, because you're driving around\n",
            "and you're just so nimble, and you're in this giant truck. CA: Wait, you've already driven a prototype?\n",
            "EM: Yeah, I drove it around the parking lot, and I was like, this is crazy. CA: Wow. This is no vaporware.\n",
            "EM: It's just like, driving this giant truck and making these mad maneuvers. CA: This is cool. OK, from a really badass picture\n",
            "to a kind of less badass picture. This is just a cute house from \"Desperate Housewives\" or something.\n",
            "What on earth is going on here? EM: Well, this illustrates the picture of the future\n",
            "that I think is how things will evolve. You've got an electric car in the driveway.\n",
            "If you look in between the electric car and the house, there are actually three Powerwalls stacked up against the side of the house,\n",
            "and then that house roof is a solar roof. So that's an actual solar glass roof. CA: OK.\n",
            "EM: That's a picture of a real -- well, admittedly, it's a real fake house. That's a real fake house.\n",
            "(Laughter) CA: So these roof tiles, some of them have in them basically solar power, the ability to --\n",
            "EM: Yeah. Solar glass tiles where you can adjust the texture and the color\n",
            "to a very fine-grained level, and then there's sort of microlouvers in the glass,\n",
            "such that when you're looking at the roof from street level or close to street level,\n",
            "all the tiles look the same whether there is a solar cell behind it or not.\n",
            "So you have an even color from the ground level.\n",
            "If you were to look at it from a helicopter, you would be actually able to look through and see that some of the glass tiles have a solar cell behind them and some do not.\n",
            "You can't tell from street level. CA: You put them in the ones that are likely to see a lot of sun, and that makes these roofs super affordable, right?\n",
            "They're not that much more expensive than just tiling the roof. EM: Yeah.\n",
            "We're very confident that the cost of the roof plus the cost of electricity --\n",
            "A solar glass roof will be less than the cost of a normal roof plus the cost of electricity. So in other words,\n",
            "this will be economically a no-brainer, we think it will look great,\n",
            "and it will last -- We thought about having the warranty be infinity,\n",
            "but then people thought, well, that might sound like were just talking rubbish, but actually this is toughened glass.\n",
            "Well after the house has collapsed and there's nothing there, the glass tiles will still be there.\n",
            "(Applause) CA: I mean, this is cool. So you're rolling this out in a couple week's time, I think,\n",
            "with four different roofing types. EM: Yeah, we're starting off with two, two initially,\n",
            "and the second two will be introduced early next year. CA: And what's the scale of ambition here?\n",
            "How many houses do you believe could end up having this type of roofing?\n",
            "EM: I think eventually almost all houses will have a solar roof.\n",
            "The thing is to consider the time scale here to be probably on the order\n",
            "of 40 or 50 years. So on average, a roof is replaced every 20 to 25 years.\n",
            "But you don't start replacing all roofs immediately. But eventually, if you say were to fast-forward\n",
            "to say 15 years from now, it will be unusual to have a roof that does not have solar.\n",
            "CA: Is there a mental model thing that people don't get here that because of the shift in the cost, the economics of solar power,\n",
            "most houses actually have enough sunlight on their roof pretty much to power all of their needs.\n",
            "If you could capture the power, it could pretty much power all their needs. You could go off-grid, kind of.\n",
            "EM: It depends on where you are and what the house size is relative to the roof area, but it's a fair statement to say\n",
            "that most houses in the US have enough roof area to power all the needs of the house.\n",
            "CA: So the key to the economics of the cars, the Semi, of these houses\n",
            "is the falling price of lithium-ion batteries, which you've made a huge bet on as Tesla.\n",
            "In many ways, that's almost the core competency. And you've decided that to really, like, own that competency,\n",
            "you just have to build the world's largest manufacturing plant to double the world's supply of lithium-ion batteries,\n",
            "with this guy. What is this? EM: Yeah, so that's the Gigafactory,\n",
            "progress so far on the Gigafactory. Eventually, you can sort of roughly see that there's sort of a diamond shape overall,\n",
            "and when it's fully done, it'll look like a giant diamond, or that's the idea behind it,\n",
            "and it's aligned on true north. It's a small detail. CA: And capable of producing, eventually,\n",
            "like a hundred gigawatt hours of batteries a year. EM: A hundred gigawatt hours. We think probably more, but yeah.\n",
            "CA: And they're actually being produced right now. EM: They're in production already. CA: You guys put out this video.\n",
            "I mean, is that speeded up? EM: That's the slowed down version. (Laughter) CA: How fast does it actually go?\n",
            "EM: Well, when it's running at full speed, you can't actually see the cells without a strobe light.\n",
            "It's just blur. (Laughter) CA: One of your core ideas, Elon, about what makes an exciting future\n",
            "is a future where we no longer feel guilty about energy. Help us picture this.\n",
            "How many Gigafactories, if you like, does it take to get us there?\n",
            "EM: It's about a hundred, roughly. It's not 10, it's not a thousand. Most likely a hundred.\n",
            "CA: See, I find this amazing. You can picture what it would take\n",
            "to move the world off this vast fossil fuel thing. It's like you're building one,\n",
            "it costs five billion dollars, or whatever, five to 10 billion dollars.\n",
            "Like, it's kind of cool that you can picture that project. And you're planning to do, at Tesla -- announce another two this year.\n",
            "EM: I think we'll announce locations for somewhere between two and four Gigafactories later this year.\n",
            "Yeah, probably four. CA: Whoa. (Applause)\n",
            "No more teasing from you for here? Like -- where, continent?\n",
            "You can say no. EM: We need to address a global market.\n",
            "CA: OK. (Laughter) This is cool.\n",
            "I think we should talk for --\n",
            "Actually, global market. I'm going to ask you one question about politics, only one.\n",
            "I'm kind of sick of politics, but I do want to ask you this. You're on a body now giving advice to a guy --\n",
            "EM: Who? CA: Who has said he doesn't really believe in climate change, and there's a lot of people out there who think you shouldn't be doing that.\n",
            "They'd like you to walk away from that. What would you say to them? EM: Well, I think that first of all,\n",
            "I'm just on two advisory councils where the format consists of going around the room\n",
            "and asking people's opinion on things, and so there's like a meeting every month or two.\n",
            "That's the sum total of my contribution. But I think to the degree that there are people in the room\n",
            "who are arguing in favor of doing something about climate change, or social issues,\n",
            "I've used the meetings I've had thus far to argue in favor of immigration and in favor of climate change.\n",
            "(Applause) And if I hadn't done that, that wasn't on the agenda before.\n",
            "So maybe nothing will happen, but at least the words were said.\n",
            "CA: OK. (Applause)\n",
            "So let's talk SpaceX and Mars. Last time you were here,\n",
            "you spoke about what seemed like a kind of incredibly ambitious dream to develop rockets that were actually reusable.\n",
            "And you've only gone and done it. EM: Finally. It took a long time. CA: Talk us through this. What are we looking at here?\n",
            "EM: So this is one of our rocket boosters coming back from very high and fast in space.\n",
            "So just delivered the upper stage at high velocity.\n",
            "I think this might have been at sort of Mach 7 or so, delivery of the upper stage.\n",
            "(Applause) CA: So that was a sped-up -- EM: That was the slowed down version.\n",
            "(Laughter) CA: I thought that was the sped-up version. But I mean, that's amazing,\n",
            "and several of these failed before you finally figured out how to do it, but now you've done this, what, five or six times?\n",
            "EM: We're at eight or nine. CA: And for the first time, you've actually reflown one of the rockets that landed.\n",
            "EM: Yeah, so we landed the rocket booster and then prepped it for flight again and flew it again,\n",
            "so it's the first reflight of an orbital booster\n",
            "where that reflight is relevant. So it's important to appreciate that reusability is only relevant\n",
            "if it is rapid and complete. So like an aircraft or a car,\n",
            "the reusability is rapid and complete. You do not send your aircraft to Boeing in-between flights.\n",
            "CA: Right. So this is allowing you to dream of this really ambitious idea of sending many, many, many people to Mars\n",
            "in, what, 10 or 20 years time, I guess. EM: Yeah. CA: And you've designed this outrageous rocket to do it.\n",
            "Help us understand the scale of this thing. EM: Well, visually you can see that's a person.\n",
            "Yeah, and that's the vehicle. (Laughter) CA: So if that was a skyscraper,\n",
            "that's like, did I read that, a 40-story skyscraper? EM: Probably a little more, yeah.\n",
            "The thrust level of this is really --\n",
            "This configuration is about four times the thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket.\n",
            "CA: Four times the thrust of the biggest rocket humanity ever created before. EM: Yeah. Yeah.\n",
            "CA: As one does. EM: Yeah. (Laughter) In units of 747, a 747 is only about a quarter of a million pounds of thrust,\n",
            "so for every 10 million pounds of thrust, there's 40 747s. So this would be the thrust equivalent of 120 747s, with all engines blazing.\n",
            "CA: And so even with a machine designed to escape Earth's gravity, I think you told me last time\n",
            "this thing could actually take a fully loaded 747, people, cargo, everything,\n",
            "into orbit. EM: Exactly. This can take a fully loaded 747 with maximum fuel,\n",
            "maximum passengers, maximum cargo on the 747 -- this can take it as cargo.\n",
            "CA: So based on this, you presented recently this Interplanetary Transport System\n",
            "which is visualized this way. This is a scene you picture in, what, 30 years time? 20 years time?\n",
            "People walking into this rocket. EM: I'm hopeful it's sort of an eight- to 10-year time frame.\n",
            "Aspirationally, that's our target. Our internal targets are more aggressive, but I think --\n",
            "(Laughter) CA: OK.\n",
            "EM: While vehicle seems quite large and is large by comparison with other rockets, I think the future spacecraft\n",
            "will make this look like a rowboat.\n",
            "The future spaceships will be truly enormous. CA: Why, Elon?\n",
            "Why do we need to build a city on Mars with a million people on it in your lifetime,\n",
            "which I think is kind of what you've said you'd love to do? EM: I think it's important to have\n",
            "a future that is inspiring and appealing. I just think there have to be reasons\n",
            "that you get up in the morning and you want to live. Like, why do you want to live? What's the point? What inspires you?\n",
            "What do you love about the future? And if we're not out there, if the future does not include being out there among the stars\n",
            "and being a multiplanet species, I find that it's incredibly depressing if that's not the future that we're going to have.\n",
            "(Applause) CA: People want to position this as an either or,\n",
            "that there are so many desperate things happening on the planet now from climate to poverty to, you know, you pick your issue.\n",
            "And this feels like a distraction. You shouldn't be thinking about this. You should be solving what's here and now.\n",
            "And to be fair, you've done a fair old bit to actually do that with your work on sustainable energy.\n",
            "But why not just do that? EM: I think there's --\n",
            "I look at the future from the standpoint of probabilities. It's like a branching stream of probabilities,\n",
            "and there are actions that we can take that affect those probabilities\n",
            "or that accelerate one thing or slow down another thing. I may introduce something new to the probability stream.\n",
            "Sustainable energy will happen no matter what. If there was no Tesla, if Tesla never existed, it would have to happen out of necessity.\n",
            "It's tautological. If you don't have sustainable energy, it means you have unsustainable energy.\n",
            "Eventually you will run out, and the laws of economics will drive civilization\n",
            "towards sustainable energy, inevitably. The fundamental value of a company like Tesla\n",
            "is the degree to which it accelerates the advent of sustainable energy, faster than it would otherwise occur.\n",
            "So when I think, like, what is the fundamental good of a company like Tesla, I would say, hopefully,\n",
            "if it accelerated that by a decade, potentially more than a decade,\n",
            "that would be quite a good thing to occur. That's what I consider to be the fundamental aspirational good of Tesla.\n",
            "Then there's becoming a multiplanet species and space-faring civilization.\n",
            "This is not inevitable. It's very important to appreciate this is not inevitable. The sustainable energy future I think is largely inevitable,\n",
            "but being a space-faring civilization is definitely not inevitable. If you look at the progress in space,\n",
            "in 1969 you were able to send somebody to the moon. 1969.\n",
            "Then we had the Space Shuttle. The Space Shuttle could only take people to low Earth orbit.\n",
            "Then the Space Shuttle retired, and the United States could take no one to orbit.\n",
            "So that's the trend. The trend is like down to nothing.\n",
            "People are mistaken when they think that technology just automatically improves. It does not automatically improve.\n",
            "It only improves if a lot of people work very hard to make it better, and actually it will, I think, by itself degrade, actually.\n",
            "You look at great civilizations like Ancient Egypt, and they were able to make the pyramids, and they forgot how to do that.\n",
            "And then the Romans, they built these incredible aqueducts. They forgot how to do it.\n",
            "CA: Elon, it almost seems, listening to you and looking at the different things you've done, that you've got this unique double motivation on everything\n",
            "that I find so interesting. One is this desire to work for humanity's long-term good.\n",
            "The other is the desire to do something exciting. And often it feels like you feel like you need the one to drive the other.\n",
            "With Tesla, you want to have sustainable energy, so you made these super sexy, exciting cars to do it.\n",
            "Solar energy, we need to get there, so we need to make these beautiful roofs. We haven't even spoken about your newest thing,\n",
            "which we don't have time to do, but you want to save humanity from bad AI, and so you're going to create this really cool brain-machine interface\n",
            "to give us all infinite memory and telepathy and so forth. And on Mars, it feels like what you're saying is,\n",
            "yeah, we need to save humanity and have a backup plan,\n",
            "but also we need to inspire humanity, and this is a way to inspire.\n",
            "EM: I think the value of beauty and inspiration is very much underrated,\n",
            "no question. But I want to be clear. I'm not trying to be anyone's savior. That is not the --\n",
            "I'm just trying to think about the future and not be sad.\n",
            "(Applause) CA: Beautiful statement.\n",
            "I think everyone here would agree that it is not -- None of this is going to happen inevitably.\n",
            "The fact that in your mind, you dream this stuff, you dream stuff that no one else would dare dream,\n",
            "or no one else would be capable of dreaming at the level of complexity that you do.\n",
            "The fact that you do that, Elon Musk, is a really remarkable thing. Thank you for helping us all to dream a bit bigger.\n",
            "EM: But you'll tell me if it ever starts getting genuinely insane, right? (Laughter)\n",
            "CA: Thank you, Elon Musk. That was really, really fantastic. That was really fantastic. (Applause)\n"

            "It was really important work, but it was also incredibly difficult.\n",
            "Every single day, we were making decisions\n",
            "that affected the accuracy of our numbers --\n",

            "So I started to feel really determined\n",

            "is to have as many people as possible be able to question them.\n",

            "and even their trust in the media,\n",
            "has been the use of political polls.\n",
            "I personally have a lot of issues with political polls\n",

            "and of course, the most recent US presidential election,\n",
            "using polls to predict electoral outcomes\n",
            "is about as accurate as using the moon to predict hospital admissions.\n",
            "No, seriously, I used actual data from an academic study to draw this.\n",
            "There are a lot of reasons why polling has become so inaccurate.\n",
            "Our societies have become really diverse,\n",
            "which makes it difficult for pollsters to get a really nice representative sample\n",
            "of the population for their polls.\n",
            "People are really reluctant to answer their phones to pollsters,\n",
            "and also, shockingly enough, people might lie.\n",

            "When you hear a statistic, you might feel skeptical.\n",
            "As soon as it's buried in a chart,\n",
            "it feels like some kind of objective science,\n",
            "and it's not.\n",
            "So I was trying to find ways to better communicate this to people,\n",
            "to show people the uncertainty in our numbers.\n",
            "What I did was I started taking real data sets,\n",
            "and turning them into hand-drawn visualizations,\n",
            "so that people can see how imprecise the data is;\n",
            "so people can see that a human did this,\n",
            "a human found the data and visualized it.\n",
            "For example, instead of finding out the probability\n",
            "of getting the flu in any given month,\n",
            "you can see the rough distribution of flu season.\n",
            "This is --\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "a bad shot to show in February.\n",
            "But it's also more responsible data visualization,\n",

            "maybe that would encourage people to get their flu jabs\n",
            "at the wrong time.\n",
            "The point of these shaky lines\n",
            "is so that people remember these imprecisions,\n",
            "but also so they don't necessarily walk away with a specific number,\n",
            "but they can remember important facts.\n",
            "Facts like injustice and inequality leave a huge mark on our lives.\n",
            "Facts like Black Americans and Native Americans have shorter life expectancies\n",

            "Facts like prisoners in the US can be kept in solitary confinement cells\n",
            "that are smaller than the size of an average parking space.\n",
            "The point of these visualizations is also to remind people\n",
            "of some really important statistical concepts,\n",
            "concepts like averages.\n",
            "So let's say you hear a claim like,\n",
            "\"The average swimming pool in the US contains 6.23 fecal accidents.\"\n",
            "That doesn't mean every single swimming pool in the country\n",
            "contains exactly 6.23 turds.\n",
            "So in order to show that,\n",
            "I went back to the original data, which comes from the CDC,\n",
            "who surveyed 47 swimming facilities.\n",
            "And I just spent one evening redistributing poop.\n",
            "So you can kind of see how misleading averages can be.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "OK, so the second question that you guys should be asking yourselves\n",
            "to spot bad numbers is:\n",
            "Can I see myself in the data?\n",
            "This question is also about averages in a way,\n",
            "because part of the reason why people are so frustrated\n",
            "with these national statistics,\n",
            "is they don't really tell the story of who's winning and who's losing\n",
            "from national policy.\n",
            "It's easy to understand why people are frustrated with global averages\n",
            "when they don't match up with their personal experiences.\n",
            "I wanted to show people the way data relates to their everyday lives.\n",
            "I started this advice column called \"Dear Mona,\"\n",
            "where people would write to me with questions and concerns\n",
            "and I'd try to answer them with data.\n",
            "People asked me anything.\n",
            "questions like, \"Is it normal to sleep in a separate bed to my wife?\"\n",
            "\"Do people regret their tattoos?\"\n",
            "\"What does it mean to die of natural causes?\"\n",
            "All of these questions are great, because they make you think\n",
            "about ways to find and communicate these numbers.\n",
            "If someone asks you, \"How much pee is a lot of pee?\"\n",
            "which is a question that I got asked,\n",
            "you really want to make sure that the visualization makes sense\n",
            "to as many people as possible.\n",
            "These numbers aren't unavailable.\n",
            "Sometimes they're just buried in the appendix of an academic study.\n",
            "And they're certainly not inscrutable;\n",
            "if you really wanted to test these numbers on urination volume,\n",
            "you could grab a bottle and try it for yourself.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "The point of this isn't necessarily\n",
            "that every single data set has to relate specifically to you.\n",
            "I'm interested in how many women were issued fines in France\n",
            "for wearing the face veil, or the niqab,\n",
            "even if I don't live in France or wear the face veil.\n",
            "The point of asking where you fit in is to get as much context as possible.\n",
            "So it's about zooming out from one data point,\n",
            "like the unemployment rate is five percent,\n",
            "and seeing how it changes over time,\n",
            "or seeing how it changes by educational status --\n",
            "this is why your parents always wanted you to go to college --\n",
            "or seeing how it varies by gender.\n",
            "Nowadays, male unemployment rate is higher\n",
            "than the female unemployment rate.\n",
            "Up until the early '80s, it was the other way around.\n",
            "This is a story of one of the biggest changes\n",
            "that's happened in American society,\n",
            "and it's all there in that chart, once you look beyond the averages.\n",
            "The axes are everything;\n",
            "once you change the scale, you can change the story.\n",
            "OK, so the third and final question that I want you guys to think about\n",
            "when you're looking at statistics is:\n",
            "How was the data collected?\n",
            "So far, I've only talked about the way data is communicated,\n",
            "but the way it's collected matters just as much.\n",
            "I know this is tough,\n",
            "because methodologies can be opaque and actually kind of boring,\n",
            "but there are some simple steps you can take to check this.\n",
            "I'll use one last example here.\n",
            "One poll found that 41 percent of Muslims in this country support jihad,\n",
            "which is obviously pretty scary,\n",
            "and it was reported everywhere in 2015.\n",
            "When I want to check a number like that,\n",
            "I'll start off by finding the original questionnaire.\n",
            "It turns out that journalists who reported on that statistic\n",
            "ignored a question lower down on the survey\n",
            "that asked respondents how they defined \"jihad.\"\n",
            "And most of them defined it as,\n",
            "\"Muslims' personal, peaceful struggle to be more religious.\"\n",
            "Only 16 percent defined it as, \"violent holy war against unbelievers.\"\n",
            "This is the really important point:\n",
            "based on those numbers, it's totally possible\n",
            "that no one in the survey who defined it as violent holy war\n",
            "also said they support it.\n",
            "Those two groups might not overlap at all.\n",
            "It's also worth asking how the survey was carried out.\n",
            "This was something called an opt-in poll,\n",
            "which means anyone could have found it on the internet and completed it.\n",
            "There's no way of knowing if those people even identified as Muslim.\n",
            "And finally, there were 600 respondents in that poll.\n",
            "There are roughly three million Muslims in this country,\n",
            "according to Pew Research Center.\n",
            "That means the poll spoke to roughly one in every 5,000 Muslims\n",
            "in this country.\n",
            "This is one of the reasons\n",
            "why government statistics are often better than private statistics.\n",
            "A poll might speak to a couple hundred people, maybe a thousand,\n",
            "or if you're L'Oreal, trying to sell skin care products in 2005,\n",
            "then you spoke to 48 women to claim that they work.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Private companies don't have a huge interest in getting the numbers right,\n",
            "they just need the right numbers.\n",
            "Government statisticians aren't like that.\n",
            "In theory, at least, they're totally impartial,\n",
            "not least because most of them do their jobs regardless of who's in power.\n",
            "They're civil servants.\n",
            "And to do their jobs properly,\n",
            "they don't just speak to a couple hundred people.\n",
            "Those unemployment numbers I keep on referencing\n",
            "come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics,\n",
            "and to make their estimates,\n",
            "they speak to over 140,000 businesses in this country.\n",
            "I get it, it's frustrating.\n",
            "If you want to test a statistic that comes from a private company,\n",
            "you can buy the face cream for you and a bunch of friends, test it out,\n",
            "if it doesn't work, you can say the numbers were wrong.\n",
            "But how do you question government statistics?\n",
            "You just keep checking everything.\n",
            "Find out how they collected the numbers.\n",
            "Find out if you're seeing everything on the chart you need to see.\n",
            "But don't give up on the numbers altogether, because if you do,\n",
            "we'll be making public policy decisions in the dark,\n",
            "using nothing but private interests to guide us.\n",
            "Thank you.\n",

            "to themselves.\n",
            "Why?\n",
            "Because they're worried about competitive advantage,\n",

            "We need to effectively democratize threat intelligence data.\n",

            "The bad guys are moving fast;\n",
            "we've got to move faster.\n",
            "And the best way to do that is to open up\n",
            "and share data on what's happening.\n",
            "Let's think about this in the construct of security professionals.\n",
            "Remember, they're programmed right into their DNA to keep secrets.\n",
            "We've got to turn that thinking on its head.\n",
            "We've got to get governments, private institutions\n",
            "and security companies\n",
            "willing to share information at speed.\n",
            "And here's why:\n",
            "because if you share the information,\n",
            "it's equivalent to inoculation.\n",
            "And if you're not sharing,\n",
            "you're actually part of the problem,\n",
            "because you're increasing the odds that other people could be impacted\n",
            "by the same attack techniques.\n",
            "But there's an even bigger benefit.\n",
            "By destroying criminals' devices closer to real time,\n",
            "we break their plans.\n",
            "We inform the people they aim to hurt\n",

            "We make cybercrime not pay.\n",
            "We change the economics for the bad guys.\n",
            "But to do this, a first mover was required --\n",

            "Then came the business:\n",
            "What are the business implications of doing that?\n",

            "of a lot of people just asking if we were completely crazy.\n",
            "But there was one conversation that kept floating to the surface\n",
            "in every dialogue that we would have:\n",
            "the realization that if we didn't do this,\n",
            "then we were part of the problem.\n",
            "So we did something unheard of in the security industry.\n",
            "We started publishing.\n",
            "Over 700 terabytes of actionable threat intelligence data,\n",
            "including information on real-time attacks\n",
            "that can be used to stop cybercrime in its tracks.\n",
            "And to date,\n",
            "over 4,000 organizations are leveraging this data,\n",
            "including half of the Fortune 100.\n",
            "And our hope as a next step is to get all of those organizations\n",
            "to join us in the fight,\n",

            "Sometimes I'll hear from magazines that are doing a story along these lines,\n",
            "generally on how to help their readers find an extra hour in the day.\n",

            "I'm sure many people coming up to the end of the year\n",
            "are giving or getting annual performance reviews.\n",
            "You look back over your successes over the year,\n",
            "your \"opportunities for growth.\"\n",
            "And this serves its purpose,\n",
            "but I find it's more effective to do this looking forward.\n",
            "So I want you to pretend it's the end of next year.\n",
            "You're giving yourself a performance review,\n",
            "and it has been an absolutely amazing year for you professionally.\n",
            "What three to five things did you do that made it so amazing?\n",
            "So you can write next year's performance review now.\n",
            "And you can do this for your personal life, too.\n",
            "I'm sure many of you, like me, come December,\n",
            "get cards that contain these folded up sheets of colored paper,\n",
            "on which is written what is known as the family holiday letter.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Bit of a wretched genre of literature, really,\n",
            "going on about how amazing everyone in the household is,\n",
            "or even more scintillating,\n",
            "how busy everyone in the household is.\n",
            "But these letters serve a purpose,\n",
            "which is that they tell your friends and family\n",
            "what you did in your personal life that mattered to you over the year.\n",
            "So this year's kind of done,\n",
            "but I want you to pretend it's the end of next year,\n",
            "and it has been an absolutely amazing year\n",
            "for you and the people you care about.\n",
            "What three to five things did you do that made it so amazing?\n",
            "So you can write next year's family holiday letter now.\n",
            "Don't send it.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Please, don't send it.\n",
            "But you can write it.\n",
            "And now, between the performance review and the family holiday letter,\n",
            "we have a list of six to ten goals we can work on in the next year.\n",
            "And now we need to break these down into doable steps.\n",
            "So maybe you want to write a family history.\n",
            "First, you can read some other family histories,\n",
            "get a sense for the style.\n",
            "Then maybe think about the questions you want to ask your relatives,\n",
            "set up appointments to interview them.\n",
            "Or maybe you want to run a 5K.\n",
            "So you need to find a race and sign up, figure out a training plan,\n",
            "and dig those shoes out of the back of the closet.\n",
            "And then -- this is key --\n",
            "we treat our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater,\n",
            "by putting them into our schedules first.\n",
            "We do this by thinking through our weeks before we are in them.\n",
            "I find a really good time to do this is Friday afternoons.\n",
            "Friday afternoon is what an economist might call\n",

            "\"I am excited to make progress\n",

            "right now.\"\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "But we are willing to think about what those should be.\n",
            "So take a little bit of time Friday afternoon,\n",

            "relationships, self --\n",
            "not so much.\n",
            "But anyway, just a short list,\n",
            "two to three items in each.\n",
            "Then look out over the whole of the next week,\n",
            "and see where you can plan them in.\n",
            "Where you plan them in is up to you.\n",
            "I know this is going to be more complicated for some people than others.\n",
            "I mean, some people's lives are just harder than others.\n",
            "It is not going to be easy to find time to take that poetry class\n",
            "if you are caring for multiple children on your own.\n",
            "I get that.\n",
            "And I don't want to minimize anyone's struggle.\n",
            "But I do think that the numbers I am about to tell you are empowering.\n",
            "There are 168 hours in a week.\n",
            "Twenty-four times seven is 168 hours.\n",
            "That is a lot of time.\n",
            "If you are working a full-time job, so 40 hours a week,\n",
            "sleeping eight hours a night, so 56 hours a week --\n",
            "that leaves 72 hours for other things.\n",
            "That is a lot of time.\n",
            "You say you're working 50 hours a week,\n",
            "maybe a main job and a side hustle.\n",
            "Well, that leaves 62 hours for other things.\n",

            "Well, are you sure?\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "There was once a study comparing people's estimated work weeks\n",
            "with time diaries.\n",
            "They found that people claiming 75-plus-hour work weeks\n",
            "were off by about 25 hours.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "You can guess in which direction, right?\n",
            "Anyway, in 168 hours a week,\n",
            "I think we can find time for what matters to you.\n",

            "you want to exercise for three hours and volunteer for two,\n",
            "you can.\n",
            "And that's even if you're working way more than full-time hours.\n",
            "So we have plenty of time, which is great,\n",
            "because guess what?\n",
            "We don't even need that much time to do amazing things.\n",
            "But when most of us have bits of time, what do we do?\n",
            "Pull out the phone, right?\n",
            "Start deleting emails.\n",
            "Otherwise, we're puttering around the house\n",
            "or watching TV.\n",
            "But small moments can have great power.\n",
            "You can use your bits of time\n",
            "for bits of joy.\n",
            "Maybe it's choosing to read something wonderful on the bus\n",
            "on the way to work.\n",
            "I know when I had a job that required two bus rides\n",

That's the ambitious goal of The Plastic Bank: a worldwide chain of stores where everything from school tuition to cooking fuel and more is available for purchase in exchange for plastic garbage -- which is then sorted, shredded and sold to brands who reuse \"social plastic\" in their products.

        "video_description": "The words we use to describe our emotions affect how we feel, says historian Tiffany Watt Smith, and they've often changed (sometimes very dramatically) in response to new cultural expectations and ideas. Take nostalgia, for instance: first defined in 1688 as an illness and considered deadly, today it's seen as a much less serious affliction. In this fascinating talk about the history of emotions, learn more about how the language we use to describe how we feel continues to evolve -- and pick up some new words used in different cultures to capture those fleeting feelings in words.\n\nCheck out more TED Talks: ",

For the past 25 years, psychology professor Lisa Feldman Barrett has mapped facial expressions, scanned brains and analyzed hundreds of physiology studies to understand what emotions really are. She shares the results of her exhaustive research -- and explains how we may have more control over our emotions than we think.\n\nCheck out more TED Talks: ",

            "Neither can I, and neither can you,\n",
            "and that's because emotions are not what we think they are.\n",
            "They are not universally expressed and recognized.\n",
            "They are not hardwired brain reactions\n",
            "that are uncontrollable.\n",
            "We have misunderstood the nature of emotion\n",

            "and understanding what emotions really are has important consequences for all of us.\n",
            "I have studied emotions as a scientist for the past 25 years,\n",
            "and in my lab, we have probed human faces by measuring electrical signals\n",

            "We've scanned hundreds of brains,\n",

            "In fact, no brain on this planet contains emotion circuits.\n",

            "Well, strap on your seat belt, because ...\n",
            "emotions are guesses.\n",
            "They are guesses that your brain constructs in the moment\n",
            "where billions of brain cells are working together,\n",
            "and you have more control over those guesses\n",
            "than you might imagine that you do.\n",
            "Now, if that sounds preposterous to you, or, you know, kind of crazy,\n",

            "I am fairly sure that I wouldn't believe it either.\n",

            "They are just built.\n",
            "To see what I mean, have a look at this.\n",
            "Right now, your brain is working like crazy.\n",
            "Your neurons are firing like mad trying to make meaning out of this\n",
            "so that you see something other than black and white blobs.\n",
            "Your brain is sifting through a lifetime of experience,\n",

            "Because as your brain is sifting through your past experience,\n",
            "there's new knowledge there,\n",
            "the knowledge that came from the photograph.\n",
            "And what's really cool is that\n",
            "that knowledge which you just acquired moments ago\n",
            "is changing how you experience these blobs right now.\n",
            "So your brain is constructing the image of a snake\n",
            "where there is no snake,\n",
            "and this kind of a hallucination\n",
            "is what neuroscientists like me call \"predictions.\"\n",

            "Audience: Mouth. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Mouth. Exactly.\n",

            "They help us to make sense of the world in a quick and efficient way.\n",
            "So your brain does not react to the world.\n",
            "Using past experience,\n",
            "your brain predicts and constructs\n",
            "your experience of the world.\n",
            "The way that we see emotions in others are deeply rooted in predictions.\n",
            "So to us, it feels like we just look at someone's face,\n",
            "and we just read the emotion that's there in their facial expressions\n",
            "the way that we would read words on a page.\n",
            "But actually, under the hood, your brain is predicting.\n",
            "It's using past experience based on similar situations\n",
            "to try to make meaning.\n",
            "This time, you're not making meaning of blobs,\n",
            "you're making meaning of facial movements\n",
            "like the curl of a lip or the raise of an eyebrow.\n",
            "And that stone-faced stare?\n",
            "That might be someone who is a remorseless killer,\n",
            "but a stone-faced stare might also mean\n",
            "that someone is stoically accepting defeat,\n",
            "which is in fact what Chechen culture prescribes for someone\n",
            "in Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's situation.\n",
            "So the lesson here\n",
            "is that emotions that you seem to detect in other people\n",
            "actually come in part from what's inside your own head.\n",
            "And this is true in the courtroom,\n",
            "but it's also true in the classroom,\n",
            "in the bedroom,\n",
            "and in the boardroom.\n",
            "And so here's my concern:\n",
            "tech companies which shall remain nameless ...\n",
            "well, maybe not.\n",
            "You know, Google, Facebook --\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "are spending millions of research dollars to build emotion-detection systems,\n",
            "and they are fundamentally asking the wrong question,\n",
            "because they're trying to detect emotions in the face and the body,\n",
            "but emotions aren't in your face and body.\n",
            "Physical movements have no intrinsic emotional meaning.\n",
            "We have to make them meaningful.\n",
            "A human or something else has to connect them to the context,\n",
            "and that makes them meaningful.\n",
            "That's how we know that a smile might mean sadness\n",
            "and a cry might mean happiness,\n",
            "and a stoic, still face might mean\n",
            "that you are angrily plotting the demise of your enemy.\n",
            "Now, if I haven't already gone out on a limb,\n",
            "I'll just edge out on that limb a little further and tell you\n",
            "that the way that you experience your own emotion\n",
            "is exactly the same process.\n",
            "Your brain is basically making predictions, guesses,\n",
            "that it's constructing in the moment\n",
            "with billions of neurons working together.\n",
            "Now your brain does come prewired to make some feelings,\n",
            "simple feelings that come from the physiology of your body.\n",
            "So when you're born,\n",
            "you can make feelings like calmness and agitation,\n",
            "excitement, comfort, discomfort.\n",
            "But these simple feelings are not emotions.\n",
            "They're actually with you every waking moment of your life.\n",
            "They are simple summaries of what's going on inside your body,\n",
            "kind of like a barometer.\n",
            "But they have very little detail,\n",
            "and you need that detail to know what to do next.\n",
            "What do you about these feelings?\n",
            "And so how does your brain give you that detail?\n",
            "Well, that's what predictions are.\n",
            "Predictions link the sensations in your body\n",
            "that give you these simple feelings\n",
            "with what's going on around you in the world\n",
            "so that you know what to do.\n",
            "And sometimes,\n",
            "those constructions are emotions.\n",
            "So for example, if you were to walk into a bakery,\n",
            "your brain might predict that you will encounter\n",
            "the delicious aroma of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies.\n",
            "I know my brain would predict\n",
            "the delicious aroma of freshly baked chocolate cookies.\n",
            "And our brains might cause our stomachs to churn a little bit,\n",
            "to prepare for eating those cookies.\n",
            "And if we are correct,\n",
            "if in fact some cookies have just come out of the oven,\n",
            "then our brains will have constructed hunger,\n",
            "and we are prepared to munch down those cookies\n",
            "and digest them in a very efficient way,\n",
            "meaning that we can eat a lot of them,\n",
            "which would be a really good thing.\n",
            "You guys are not laughing enough. I'm totally serious.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "But here's the thing.\n",
            "That churning stomach,\n",
            "if it occurs in a different situation,\n",
            "it can have a completely different meaning.\n",
            "So if your brain were to predict a churning stomach\n",
            "in, say, a hospital room while you're waiting for test results,\n",
            "then your brain will be constructing dread\n",
            "or worry or anxiety,\n",
            "and it might cause you to, maybe,\n",
            "wring your hands\n",
            "or take a deep breath or even cry.\n",
            "Right? Same physical sensation, same churning stomach,\n",
            "different experience.\n",
            "And so the lesson here\n",
            "is that emotions which seem to happen to you\n",
            "are actually made by you.\n",
            "You are not at the mercy of mythical emotion circuits\n",
            "which are buried deep inside some ancient part of your brain.\n",
            "You have more control over your emotions\n",
            "than you think you do.\n",
            "I don't mean that you can just snap your fingers\n",
            "and change how you feel the way that you would change your clothes,\n",
            "but your brain is wired\n",
            "so that if you change the ingredients that your brain uses to make emotion,\n",
            "then you can transform your emotional life.\n",
            "So if you change those ingredients today,\n",
            "you're basically teaching your brain how to predict differently tomorrow,\n",
            "and this is what I call being the architect of your experience.\n",
            "So here's an example.\n",
            "All of us have had a nervous feeling before a test, right?\n",
            "But some people experience crippling anxiety before a test.\n",
            "They have test anxiety.\n",
            "Based on past experiences of taking tests,\n",
            "their brains predict a hammering heartbeat,\n",
            "sweaty hands,\n",
            "so much so that they are unable to actually take the test.\n",
            "They don't perform well,\n",
            "and sometimes they not only fail courses but they actually might fail college.\n",
            "But here's the thing:\n",
            "a hammering heartbeat is not necessarily anxiety.\n",
            "It could be that your body is preparing to do battle\n",
            "and ace that test ...\n",
            "or, you know, give a talk\n",
            "in front of hundreds of people on a stage where you're being filmed.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "I'm serious.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "And research shows that when students learn\n",
            "to make this kind of energized determination\n",
            "instead of anxiety,\n",
            "they perform better on tests.\n",
            "And that determination seeds their brain to predict differently in the future\n",
            "so that they can get their butterflies flying in formation.\n",
            "And if they do that often enough,\n",
            "they not only can pass a test\n",
            "but it will be easier for them to pass their courses,\n",
            "and they might even finish college,\n",
            "which has a huge impact on their future earning potential.\n",
            "So I call this emotional intelligence in action.\n",
            "Now you can cultivate this emotional intelligence yourself\n",
            "and use it in your everyday life.\n",
            "So just, you know,\n",
            "imagine waking up in the morning.\n",
            "I'm sure you've had this experience. I know I have.\n",
            "You wake up and as you're emerging into consciousness,\n",
            "you feel this horrible dread,\n",
            "you know, this real wretchedness,\n",
            "and immediately, your mind starts to race.\n",
            "You start to think about all the crap that you have to do at work\n",
            "and you have that mountain of email\n",
            "which you will never dig yourself out of ever,\n",
            "the phone calls you have to return,\n",

            "What is wrong with your life?\n",
            "What is wrong with my life?\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "That mind racing is prediction.\n",
            "Your brain is searching to find an explanation\n",
            "for those sensations in your body that you experience as wretchedness,\n",
            "just like you did with the blobby image.\n",
            "So your brain is trying to explain what caused those sensations\n",
            "so that you know what to do about them.\n",
            "But those sensations\n",
            "might not be an indication that anything is wrong with your life.\n",
            "They might have a purely physical cause.\n",
            "Maybe you're tired.\n",

            "that was necessary to make machines smart.\n",

            "Now, for me, this little pond scum critter Tetrahymena\n",
            "was a great way to study the fundamental mystery\n",
            "I was most curious about:\n",
            "those bundles of DNA in our cells called chromosomes.\n",
            "And it was because I was curious about the very ends of chromosomes,\n",
            "known as telomeres.\n",
            "Now, when I started my quest,\n",
            "all we knew was that they helped protect the ends of chromosomes.\n",
            "It was important when cells divide.\n",
            "It was really important,\n",
            "but I wanted to find out what telomeres consisted of,\n",
            "and for that, I needed a lot of them.\n",
            "And it so happens that cute little Tetrahymena\n",
            "has a lot of short linear chromosomes,\n",
            "around 20,000,\n",
            "so lots of telomeres.\n",
            "And I discovered that telomeres consisted of special segments\n",
            "of noncoding DNA right at the very ends of chromosomes.\n",
            "But here's a problem.\n",
            "Now, we all start life as a single cell.\n",
            "It multiples to two. Two becomes four. Four becomes eight,\n",
            "and on and on to form the 200 million billion cells\n",
            "that make up our adult body.\n",
            "And some of those cells have to divide thousands of times.\n",
            "In fact, even as I stand here before you,\n",
            "all throughout my body, cells are furiously replenishing\n",
            "to, well, keep me standing here before you.\n",
            "So every time a cell divides, all of its DNA has to be copied,\n",
            "all of the coding DNA inside of those chromosomes,\n",
            "because that carries the vital operating instructions\n",
            "that keep our cells in good working order,\n",
            "so my heart cells can keep a steady beat,\n",
            "which I assure you they're not doing right now,\n",
            "and my immune cells\n",
            "can fight off bacteria and viruses,\n",
            "and our brain cells can save the memory of our first kiss\n",
            "and keep on learning throughout life.\n",
            "But there is a glitch in the way DNA is copied.\n",
            "It is just one of those facts of life.\n",
            "Every time the cell divides and the DNA is copied,\n",
            "some of that DNA from the ends gets worn down and shortened,\n",
            "some of that telomere DNA.\n",
            "And think about it\n",
            "like the protective caps at the ends of your shoelace.\n",
            "And those keep the shoelace, or the chromosome, from fraying,\n",
            "and when that tip gets too short, it falls off,\n",
            "and that worn down telomere sends a signal to the cells.\n",
            "\"The DNA is no longer being protected.\"\n",
            "It sends a signal. Time to die.\n",
            "So, end of story.\n",
            "Well, sorry, not so fast.\n",
            "It can't be the end of the story,\n",
            "because life hasn't died off the face of the earth.\n",
            "So I was curious:\n",
            "if such wear and tear is inevitable,\n",
            "how on earth does Mother Nature make sure\n",
            "we can keep our chromosomes intact?\n",
            "Now, remember that little pond scum critter Tetrahymena?\n",
            "The craziest thing was, Tetrahymena cells never got old and died.\n",
            "Their telomeres weren't shortening as time marched on.\n",
            "Sometimes they even got longer.\n",
            "Something else was at work,\n",
            "and believe me, that something was not in any textbook.\n",
            "So working in my lab with my extraordinary student Carol Greider --\n",
            "and Carol and I shared the Nobel Prize for this work --\n",
            "we began running experiments\n",
            "and we discovered cells do have something else.\n",
            "It was a previously undreamed-of enzyme\n",
            "that could replenish, make longer, telomeres,\n",
            "and we named it telomerase.\n",
            "And when we removed our pond scum's telomerase,\n",
            "their telomeres ran down and they died.\n",
            "So it was thanks to their plentiful telomerase\n",
            "that our pond scum critters never got old.\n",
            "OK, now, that's an incredibly hopeful message\n",
            "for us humans to be receiving from pond scum,\n",
            "because it turns out\n",
            "that as we humans age, our telomeres do shorten,\n",
            "and remarkably, that shortening is aging us.\n",
            "Generally speaking, the longer your telomeres,\n",
            "the better off you are.\n",
            "It's the overshortening of telomeres\n",
            "that leads us to feel and see signs of aging.\n",
            "My skin cells start to die\n",
            "and I start to see fine lines, wrinkles.\n",
            "Hair pigment cells die.\n",
            "You start to see gray.\n",
            "Immune system cells die.\n",
            "You increase your risks of getting sick.\n",
            "In fact, the cumulative research from the last 20 years\n",
            "has made clear that telomere attrition\n",
            "is contributing to our risks of getting cardiovascular diseases,\n",
            "Alzheimer's, some cancers and diabetes,\n",
            "the very conditions many of us die of.\n",
            "And so we have to think about this.\n",
            "What is going on?\n",
            "This attrition,\n",
            "we look and we feel older, yeah.\n",
            "Our telomeres are losing the war of attrition faster.\n",
            "And those of us who feel youthful longer,\n",
            "it turns out our telomeres are staying longer\n",
            "for longer periods of time,\n",
            "extending our feelings of youthfulness\n",
            "and reducing the risks of all we most dread\n",
            "as the birthdays go by.\n",
            "OK,\n",
            "seems like a no-brainer.\n",
            "Now, if my telomeres are connected\n",
            "to how quickly I'm going to feel and get old,\n",
            "if my telomeres can be renewed by my telomerase,\n",
            "then all I have to do to reverse the signs and symptoms of aging\n",
            "is figure out where to buy that Costco-sized bottle\n",

            "Great! Problem solved.\n",
            "(Applause)\n",
            "Not so fast, I'm sorry.\n",
            "Alas, that's not the case.\n",
            "OK. And why?\n",
            "It's because human genetics has taught us\n",
            "that when it comes to our telomerase,\n",
            "we humans live on a knife edge.\n",
            "OK, simply put,\n",
            "yes, nudging up telomerase does decrease the risks of some diseases,\n",
            "but it also increases the risks of certain and rather nasty cancers.\n",
            "So even if you could buy that Costco-sized bottle of telomerase,\n",
            "and there are many websites marketing such dubious products,\n",
            "the problem is you could nudge up your risks of cancers.\n",
            "And we don't want that.\n",
            "Now, don't worry,\n",
            "and because, while I think it's kind of funny that right now,\n",
            "you know, many of us may be thinking, \"Well, I'd rather be like pond scum,\" ...\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "there is something for us humans\n",
            "in the story of telomeres and their maintenance.\n",
            "But I want to get one thing clear.\n",
            "It isn't about enormously extending human lifespan\n",
            "or immortality.\n",
            "It's about health span.\n",
            "Now, health span is the number of years of your life\n",
            "when you're free of disease, you're healthy, you're productive,\n",
            "you're zestfully enjoying life.\n",
            "Disease span, the opposite of health span,\n",
            "is the time of your life spent feeling old and sick and dying.\n",
            "So the real question becomes,\n",
            "OK, if I can't guzzle telomerase,\n",
            "do I have control over my telomeres' length\n",
            "and hence my well-being, my health,\n",
            "without those downsides of cancer risks?\n",
            "OK?\n",
            "So, it's the year 2000.\n",
            "Now, I've been minutely scrutinizing little teeny tiny telomeres\n",
            "very happily for many years,\n",
            "when into my lab walks a psychologist named Elissa Epel.\n",
            "Now, Elissa's expertise is in the effects of severe, chronic psychological stress\n",
            "on our mind's and our body's health.\n",
            "And there she was standing in my lab,\n",
            "which ironically overlooked the entrance to a mortuary, and --\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "And she had a life-and-death question for me.\n",
            "\"What happens to telomeres in people who are chronically stressed?\"\n",
            "she asked me.\n",
            "You see, she'd been studying caregivers,\n",
            "and specifically mothers of children with a chronic condition,\n",
            "be it gut disorder, be it autism, you name it --\n",
            "a group obviously under enormous and prolonged psychological stress.\n",
            "I have to say, her question\n",
            "changed me profoundly.\n",
            "See, all this time I had been thinking of telomeres\n",
            "as those miniscule molecular structures that they are,\n",
            "and the genes that control telomeres.\n",
            "And when Elissa asked me about studying caregivers,\n",
            "I suddenly saw telomeres in a whole new light.\n",
            "I saw beyond the genes and the chromosomes\n",
            "into the lives of the real people we were studying.\n",
            "And I'm a mom myself,\n",
            "and at that moment,\n",
            "I was struck by the image of these women\n",
            "dealing with a child with a condition\n",
            "very difficult to deal with, often without help.\n",
            "And such women, simply,\n",
            "often look worn down.\n",
            "So was it possible their telomeres were worn down as well?\n",
            "So our collective curiosity went into overdrive.\n",
            "Elissa selected for our first study a group of such caregiving mothers,\n",
            "and we wanted to ask: What's the length of their telomeres\n",
            "compared with the number of years that they have been caregiving\n",
            "for their child with a chronic condition?\n",
            "So four years go by\n",
            "and the day comes when all the results are in,\n",
            "and Elissa looked down at our first scatterplot\n",
            "and literally gasped,\n",
            "because there was a pattern to the data,\n",
            "and it was the exact gradient that we most feared might exist.\n",
            "It was right there on the page.\n",
            "The longer, the more years that is,\n",
            "the mother had been in this caregiving situation,\n",
            "no matter her age,\n",
            "the shorter were her telomeres.\n",
            "And the more she perceived\n",
            "her situation as being more stressful,\n",
            "the lower was her telomerase and the shorter were her telomeres.\n",
            "So we had discovered something unheard of:\n",
            "the more chronic stress you are under, the shorter your telomeres,\n",
            "meaning the more likely you were to fall victim to an early disease span\n",
            "and perhaps untimely death.\n",
            "Our findings meant that people's life events\n",
            "and the way we respond to these events\n",
            "can change how you maintain your telomeres.\n",
            "So telomere length wasn't just a matter of age counted in years.\n",
            "Elissa's question to me,\n",
            "back when she first came to my lab, indeed had been a life-and-death question.\n",
            "Now, luckily, hidden in that data there was hope.\n",
            "We noticed that some mothers,\n",
            "despite having been carefully caring for their children for many years,\n",
            "had been able to maintain their telomeres.\n",
            "So studying these women closely revealed that they were resilient to stress.\n",
            "Somehow they were able to experience their circumstances\n",
            "not as a threat day in and day out\n",
            "but as a challenge,\n",
            "and this has led to a very important insight for all of us:\n",
            "we have control over the way we age\n",
            "all the way down into our cells.\n",
            "OK, now our initial curiosity became infectious.\n",
            "Thousands of scientists from different fields\n",
            "added their expertise to telomere research,\n",
            "and the findings have poured in.\n",
            "It's up to over 10,000 scientific papers and counting.\n",
            "So several studies rapidly confirmed our initial finding\n",
            "that yes, chronic stress is bad for telomeres.\n",
            "And now many are revealing\n",
            "that we have more control over this particular aging process\n",
            "than any of us could ever have imagined.\n",
            "A few examples:\n",
            "a study from the University of California, Los Angeles\n",
            "of people who are caring for a relative with dementia, long-term,\n",
            "and looked at their caregiver's telomere maintenance capacity\n",
            "and found that it was improved\n",
            "by them practicing a form of meditation\n",
            "for as little as 12 minutes a day for two months.\n",
            "Attitude matters.\n",
            "If you're habitually a negative thinker,\n",
            "you typically see a stressful situation with a threat stress response,\n",
            "meaning if your boss wants to see you,\n",
            "you automatically think, \"I'm about to be fired,\"\n",
            "and your blood vessels constrict,\n",
            "and your level of the stress hormone cortisol creeps up,\n",
            "and then it stays up,\n",
            "and over time, that persistently high level of the cortisol\n",
            "actually damps down your telomerase.\n",
            "Not good for your telomeres.\n",
            "On the other hand,\n",
            "if you typically see something stressful as a challenge to be tackled,\n",
            "then blood flows to your heart and to your brain,\n",
            "and you experience a brief but energizing spike of cortisol.\n",
            "And thanks to that habitual \"bring it on\" attitude,\n",
            "your telomeres do just fine.\n",
            "So ...\n",
            "What is all of this telling us?\n",
            "Your telomeres do just fine.\n",
            "You really do have power to change what is happening\n",
            "to your own telomeres.\n",
            "But our curiosity just got more and more intense,\n",
            "because we started to wonder,\n",
            "what about factors outside our own skin?\n",
            "Could they impact our telomere maintenance as well?\n",
            "You know, we humans are intensely social beings.\n",
            "Was it even possible that our telomeres were social as well?\n",
            "And the results have been startling.\n",
            "As early as childhood,\n",
            "emotional neglect, exposure to violence,\n",
            "bullying and racism\n",
            "all impact your telomeres, and the effects are long-term.\n",

            "People who can't trust their neighbors\n",
            "and who don't feel safe in their neighborhoods\n",
            "consistently have shorter telomeres.\n",
            "So your home address matters for telomeres as well.\n",
            "On the flip side,\n",
            "tight-knit communities, being in a marriage long-term,\n",
            "and lifelong friendships, even,\n",
            "all improve telomere maintenance.\n",
            "So what is all this telling us?\n",
            "It's telling us that I have the power to impact my own telomeres,\n",
            "and I also have the power to impact yours.\n",
            "Telomere science has told us just how interconnected we all are.\n",
            "But I'm still curious.\n",

            "Then, in such a tight pipe,\n",

            "We have 100 trillion bacteria doing all sorts of things --\n",

            "The outer sphincter we all know, we can control it,\n",

            "the inner one, we really don't.\n",
            "So what happens is,\n",
            "when there are leftovers from digestion,\n",
            "they're being delivered to the inner one first.\n",
            "This inner one will open in a reflex\n",
            "and let through a little bit for testing.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "So, there are sensory cells\n",
            "that will analyze what has been delivered: Is it gaseous or is it solid?\n",
            "And they will then send this information up to our brain,\n",
            "and this is the moment when our brain knows,\n",
            "\"Oh, I have to go to the toilet.\"\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "The brain will then do what it's designed to do\n",
            "with its amazing consciousness.\n",
            "It will mediate with our surroundings,\n",
            "and it will say something like,\n",
            "\"So, I checked.\n",

            "and you know you can pull it off silently.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "But solid --\n",
            "maybe later.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Since our outer sphincter and the brain is connected with nervous cells,\n",
            "they coordinate, cooperate,\n",
            "and they put it back in a waiting line --\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "for other times,\n",
            "like, for example, when we're at home sitting on the couch,\n",
            "we have nothing better to do,\n",
            "we are free to go.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Us humans are actually one of the very few animals that do this\n",
            "in such an advanced and clean way.\n",

            "for that nice, inner sphincter dude --\n",
            "not connected to nerves\n",
            "that care too much about the outer world or the time --\n",
            "just caring about me for once.\n",
            "I thought that was nice.\n",
            "And I used to not be a great fan of public restrooms,\n",
            "but now I can go anywhere,\n",
            "because I consider it more\n",
            "when that inner muscle puts a suggestion on my daily agenda.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "And also I learned something else, which was:\n",
            "looking closely at something I might have shied away from --\n",
            "maybe the weirdest part of myself --\n",
            "left me feeling more fearless,\n",
            "and also appreciating myself more.\n",
            "And I think this happens a lot of times\n",
            "when you look at the gut, actually.\n",
            "Like those funny rumbling noises that happen\n",
            "when you're in a group of friends\n",
            "or at the office conference table,\n",
            "going, like, \"Merrr, merrr...\"\n",
            "This is not because we're hungry.\n",
            "This is because our small intestine is actually a huge neat freak,\n",
            "and it takes the time in between digestion to clean everything up,\n",
            "resulting in those eight meters of gut -- really, seven of them --\n",
            "being very clean and hardly smelling like anything.\n",
            "It will, to achieve this, create a strong muscular wave\n",
            "that moves everything forward that's been leftover after digestion.\n",
            "This can sometimes create a sound,\n",
            "but doesn't necessarily have to always.\n",
            "So what we're embarrassed of is really a sign\n",
            "of something keeping our insides fine and tidy.\n",
            "Or this weird, crooked shape of our stomach --\n",
            "a bit Quasimodo-ish.\n",
            "This actually makes us be able to put pressure on our belly\n",
            "without vomiting,\n",
            "like when we're laughing\n",
            "and when we're doing sports,\n",
            "because the pressure will go up and not so much sideways.\n",
            "This also creates this air bubble\n",
            "that's usually always very visible in X-rays, for example,\n",
            "and can sometimes, with some people,\n",
            "when it gets too big,\n",
            "create discomfort or even some sensations of pain.\n",
            "But for most of the people, is just results\n",
            "that it's far easier to burp when you're laying on your left side\n",
            "instead of your right.\n",
            "And soon I moved a bit further\n",
            "and started to look at the whole picture of our body and health.\n",
            "This was actually after I had heard\n",
            "that someone I knew a little bit had killed himself.\n",
            "It happened that I had been sitting next to that person the day before,\n",
            "and I smelled that he had very bad breath.\n",
            "And when I learned of the suicide the next day,\n",
            "I thought: Could the gut have something to do with it?\n",
            "And I frantically started searching if there were scientific papers\n",
            "on the connection of gut and brain.\n",
            "And to my surprise, I found many.\n",
            "It turns out it's maybe not as simple as we sometimes think.\n",
            "We tend to think our brain makes these commands\n",
            "and then sends them down to the other organs,\n",
            "and they all have to listen.\n",
            "But really, it's more that 10 percent of the nerves that connect brain and gut\n",
            "deliver information from the brain to the gut.\n",
            "We know this, for example, in stressful situations,\n",
            "when there are transmitters from the brain that are being sensed by our gut,\n",
            "so the gut will try to lower all the work,\n",
            "and not be working and taking away blood and energy\n",
            "to save energy for problem-solving.\n",
            "This can go as far as nervous vomiting or nervous diarrhea\n",
            "to get rid of food that it then doesn't want to digest.\n",
            "Maybe more interestingly,\n",
            "90 percent of the nervous fibers that connect gut and brain\n",
            "deliver information from our gut to our brain.\n",
            "And when you think about it a little bit,\n",
            "it does make sense, because our brain is very isolated.\n",
            "It's in this bony skull surrounded by a thick skin,\n",
            "and it needs information to put together a feeling\n",
            "of \"How am I, as a whole body, doing?\"\n",
            "And the gut, actually, is possibly the most important advisor for the brain\n",
            "because it's our largest sensory organ,\n",
            "collecting information not only on the quality of our nutrients,\n",
            "but really also on how are so many of our immune cells doing,\n",
            "or things like the hormones in our blood that it can sense.\n",
            "And it can package this information, and send it up to the brain.\n",
            "It can, there, not reach areas like visual cortex or word formations --\n",
            "otherwise, when we digest,\n",
            "we would see funny colors or we would make funny noises -- no.\n",
            "But it can reach areas for things like morality,\n",
            "fear or emotional processing\n",
            "or areas for self-awareness.\n",
            "So it does make sense\n",
            "that when our body and our brain are putting together this feeling\n",
            "of, \"How am I, as a whole body, doing?\"\n",
            "that the gut has something to contribute to this process.\n",
            "And it also makes sense\n",
            "that people who have conditions like irritable bowel syndrome\n",
            "or inflammatory bowel disease\n",
            "have a higher risk of having anxiety or depression.\n",
            "I think this is good information to share,\n",
            "because many people will think,\n",
            "\"I have this gut thing, and maybe I also have this mental health thing.\"\n",
            "And maybe -- because science is not clear on that right now --\n",
            "it's really just that the brain is feeling sympathy with their gut.\n",
            "This has yet to grow in evidence until it can come to practice.\n",
            "But just knowing about these kinds of research\n",
            "that's out there at the moment\n",
            "helps me in my daily life.\n",
            "And it makes me think differently of my moods\n",
            "and not externalize so much all the time.\n",
            "I feel oftentimes during the day we are a brain and a screen,\n",
            "and we will tend to look for answers right there\n",
            "and maybe the work is stupid or our neighbor --\n",
            "but really, moods can also come from within.\n",
            "And just knowing this helped me,\n",
            "for example, when I sometimes wake up too early,\n",
            "and I start to worry and wander around with my thoughts.\n",
            "Then I think, \"Stop. What did I eat yesterday?\n",
            "Did I stress myself out too much?\n",
            "Did I eat too late or something?\"\n",
            "And then maybe get up and make myself a tea,\n",
            "something light to digest.\n",
            "And as simple as that sounds,\n",
            "I think it's been surprisingly good for me.\n",
            "Step three took me further away from our body,\n",
            "and to really understanding bacteria differently.\n",
            "The research we have today is creating a new definition\n",
            "of what real cleanliness is.\n",
            "And it's not the hygiene hypothesis --\n",
            "I think many maybe know this.\n",
            "So it states that when you have too little microbes in your environment\n",
            "because you clean all the time,\n",
            "that's not really a good thing,\n",
            "because people get more allergies or autoimmune diseases then.\n",
            "So I knew this hypothesis,\n",
            "and I thought I wouldn't learn so much\n",
            "from looking at cleanliness in the gut.\n",
            "But I was wrong.\n",
            "It turns out,\n",
            "real cleanliness is not about killing off bacteria right away.\n",
            "Real cleanliness is a bit different.\n",
            "When we look at the facts,\n",
            "95 percent of all bacteria on this planet don't harm us -- they can't,\n",
            "they don't have the genes to do so.\n",
            "Many, actually, help us a lot,\n",
            "and scientists at the moment are looking into things like:\n",
            "Do some bacteria help us clean the gut?\n",
            "Do they help us digest?\n",
            "Do they make us put on weight or have a lean figure\n",
            "although we're eating lots?\n",
            "Are others making us feel more courageous or even more resilient to stress?\n",
            "So you see, there are more questions when it comes to cleanliness.\n",
            "And, actually, the thing is, it's about a healthy balance, I think.\n",
            "You can't avoid the bad all the time.\n",
            "This is simply not possible;\n",
            "there's always something bad around.\n",
            "So what really the whole deal is when you look at a clean gut,\n",
            "it's about having good bacteria, enough of them,\n",
            "and then some bad.\n",
            "Our immune system needs the bad, too,\n",
            "so it knows what it's looking out for.\n",
            "So I started having this different perspective on cleanliness\n",
            "and a few weeks later,\n",
            "I held a talk at my university,\n",
            "and I made a mistake by 1,000.\n",
            "And I went home and I realized in that moment,\n",
            "I was like, \"Ah! I made a mistake by 1,000.\n",
            "Oh God, that's so much, and that's so embarrassing.\"\n",
            "And I started to think about this, I was like, \"Ugh!\"\n",
            "And after a while I said,\n",
            "\"OK, I made this one mistake,\n",
            "but then I also told so many good and right and helpful things,\n",
            "so I think it's OK, you know?\n",
            "It's a clean thing.\"\n",
            "And then I was like, \"Oh, wait.\n",
            "Maybe I took my perspective on cleanliness further.\"\n",
            "And it's my theory at the moment that maybe we all do.\n",
            "Take it a bit further than just cleaning our living room,\n",
            "where maybe we make it to sort like a life hygiene.\n",
            "Knowing that this is about fostering the good\n",
            "just as much as trying to shelter yourself from the bad\n",
            "had a very calming effect on me.\n",
            "So in that sense,\n",
            "I hope today I told you mostly good and helpful things,\n",
            "and thank you for your time,\n",

            "About half the chemical energy is converted into electricity,\n",
            "and the remainder into heat,\n",
            "which is used to break down limestone\n",
            "into lime and carbon dioxide.\n",
            "Now at this point, you're probably thinking that I'm nuts.\n",
            "It's actually generating carbon dioxide.\n",
            "But the key point is, all of the carbon dioxide generated,\n",
            "both from the fuel cell and from the lime kiln, is pure,\n",
            "and that's really important,\n",
            "because it means you can either use that carbon dioxide\n",
            "or you can store it away deep underground at low cost.\n",
            "And then the lime that you produce can be used in industrial processes,\n",
            "and in being used, it scrubs CO2 out of the air.\n",
            "Overall, the process is carbon negative.\n",
            "It removes carbon dioxide from the air.\n",
            "If you normally generate electricity from natural gas,\n",
            "you emit about 400 grams of CO2 into the air\n",
            "for every kilowatt-hour.\n",
            "With this process, that figure is minus 600.\n",
            "At the moment, power generation is responsible\n",
            "for about a quarter of all carbon dioxide emissions.\n",
            "Hypothetically, if you replaced all power generation with this process,\n",
            "then you would not only eliminate all of the emissions from power generation\n",
            "but you would start removing emissions from other sectors as well,\n",
            "potentially cutting 60 percent of overall carbon emissions.\n",
            "You could even use the lime\n",
            "to add it directly to seawater to counteract ocean acidification,\n",
            "one of the other issues that is caused by CO2 in the atmosphere.\n",
            "In fact, you get more bang for your buck.\n",
            "You absorb about twice as much carbon dioxide when you add it to seawater\n",
            "as when you use it industrially.\n",
            "But this is where it gets really complicated.\n",
            "While counteracting ocean acidification is a good thing,\n",
            "we don't fully understand what the environmental consequences are,\n",
            "and so we need to assess whether this treatment\n",
            "is actually better than the disease that it is seeking to cure.\n",
            "We need to put in place step-by-step governance\n",
            "for experiments to assess this safely.\n",
            "And the scale:\n",
            "to avoid dangerous climate change,\n",
            "we are going to need to remove trillions --\n",
            "and yes, that's trillions with a T --\n",
            "trillions of tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in the decades ahead.\n",
            "It will cost a few percent of GDP -- think defense-sized expenditure,\n",
            "lots of industrial activity\n",
            "and inevitably harmful side effects.\n",
            "But if the scale seems enormous,\n",
            "it is only because of the scale of the problem\n",
            "that we are seeking to solve.\n",
            "It's enormous as well.\n",
            "We can no longer avoid these thorny issues.\n",

            "We need to grow up and face the consequences of our actions.\n",
            "(Applause)\n",
            "Does talk of curing climate change undermine the will to cut emissions?\n",
            "This is a real concern,\n",
            "so we need to emphasize the paramount importance of reducing emissions\n",
            "and how speculative these ideas are.\n",
            "But having done so, we still need to examine them.\n",
            "Can we cure climate change?\n",
            "I don't know, but we certainly can't if we don't try.\n",
            "We need ambition without arrogance.\n",
            "We need the ambition to restore the atmosphere,\n",
            "to draw down carbon dioxide\n",
            "back to a level that is compatible with a stable climate and healthy oceans.\n",
            "This will be an enormous undertaking.\n",
            "You could describe it as a cathedral project.\n",
            "Those involved at the outset\n",
            "may draft the plans and dig the foundations,\n",
            "but they will not raise the spire to its full height.\n",
            "That task, that privilege,\n",

            "that future generations will be able to finish the job.\n",
            "So, do you want to change the world?\n",

            "and our mission is to train the next generation of neuroscientists\n",
            "by taking graduate-level neuroscience research equipment\n",
            "and making it available for kids in middle schools and high schools.\n",
            "And so when we go into the classroom,\n",
            "one way to get them thinking about the brain, which is very complex,\n",
            "is to ask them a very simple question about neuroscience,\n",
            "and that is, \"What has a brain?\"\n",
            "When we ask that,\n",
            "students will instantly tell you that their cat or dog has a brain,\n",
            "and most will say that a mouse or even a small insect has a brain,\n",
            "but almost nobody says that a plant or a tree\n",
            "or a shrub has a brain.\n",
            "And so when you push --\n",
            "because this could actually help describe a little bit\n",
            "how the brain actually functions --\n",
            "so you push and say,\n",
            "\"Well, what is it that makes living things have brains versus not?\"\n",
            "And often they'll come back with the classification\n",
            "that things that move tend to have brains.\n",
            "And that's absolutely correct.\n",
            "Our nervous system evolved because it is electrical.\n",
            "It's fast, so we can quickly respond to stimuli in the world\n",
            "and move if we need to.\n",
            "But you can go back and push back on a student,\n",
            "and say, \"Well, you know, you say that plants don't have brains,\n",
            "but plants do move.\"\n",
            "Anyone who has grown a plant\n",
            "has noticed that the plant will move\n",
            "and face the sun.\n",
            "But they'll say, \"But that's a slow movement.\n",
            "You know, that doesn't count. That could be a chemical process.\"\n",
            "But what about fast-moving plants?\n",
            "Now, in 1760, Arthur Dobbs, the Royal Governor of North Carolina,\n",
            "made a pretty fascinating discovery.\n",
            "In the swamps behind his house,\n",
            "he found a plant that would spring shut\n",
            "every time a bug would fall in between it.\n",
            "He called this plant the flytrap,\n",
            "and within a decade, it made its way over to Europe,\n",
            "where eventually the great Charles Darwin got to study this plant,\n",
            "and this plant absolutely blew him away.\n",
            "He called it the most wonderful plant in the world.\n",
            "This is a plant that was an evolutionary wonder.\n",
            "This is a plant that moves quickly,\n",
            "which is rare,\n",
            "and it's carnivorous, which is also rare.\n",
            "And this is in the same plant.\n",
            "But I'm here today to tell you\n",
            "that's not even the coolest thing about this plant.\n",
            "The coolest thing is that the plant can count.\n",
            "So in order to show that,\n",
            "we have to get some vocabulary out of the way.\n",
            "So I'm going to do what we do in the classroom with students.\n",
            "We're going to do an experiment on electrophysiology,\n",
            "which is the recording of the body's electrical signal,\n",
            "either coming from neurons or from muscles.\n",
            "And I'm putting some electrodes here on my wrists.\n",
            "As I hook them up,\n",
            "we're going to be able to see a signal\n",
            "on the screen here.\n",
            "And this signal may be familiar to you.\n",
            "It's called the EKG, or the electrocardiogram.\n",
            "And this is coming from neurons in my heart\n",
            "that are firing what's called action potentials,\n",
            "potential meaning voltage and action meaning it moves quickly up and down,\n",
            "which causes my heart to fire,\n",
            "which then causes the signal that you see here.\n",
            "And so I want you to remember the shape of what we'll be looking at right here,\n",
            "because this is going to be important.\n",
            "This is a way that the brain encodes information\n",
            "in the form of an action potential.\n",
            "So now let's turn to some plants.\n",
            "So I'm going to first introduce you to the mimosa,\n",
            "not the drink, but the Mimosa pudica,\n",
            "and this is a plant that's found in Central America and South America,\n",
            "and it has behaviors.\n",
            "And the first behavior I'm going to show you\n",
            "is if I touch the leaves here,\n",
            "you get to see that the leaves tend to curl up.\n",
            "And then the second behavior is,\n",
            "if I tap the leaf,\n",
            "the entire branch seems to fall down.\n",
            "So why does it do that?\n",
            "It's not really known to science.\n",
            "One of the reasons why could be that it scares away insects\n",
            "or it looks less appealing to herbivores.\n",
            "But how does it do that? Now, that's interesting.\n",
            "We can do an experiment to find out.\n",
            "So what we're going to do now,\n",
            "just like I recorded the electrical potential from my body,\n",
            "we're going to record the electrical potential from this plant, this mimosa.\n",
            "And so what we're going to do is I've got a wire wrapped around the stem,\n",
            "and I've got the ground electrode where?\n",
            "In the ground. It's an electrical engineering joke. Alright.\n",
            "(Laughter)\n",
            "Alright. So I'm going to go ahead and tap the leaf here,\n",
            "and I want you to look at the electrical recording\n",
            "that we're going to see inside the plant.\n",
            "Whoa. It is so big, I've got to scale it down.\n",
            "Alright. So what is that?\n",
            "That is an action potential that is happening inside the plant.\n",
            "Why was it happening?\n",
            "Because it wanted to move. Right?\n",
            "And so when I hit the touch receptors,\n",
            "it sent a voltage all the way down to the end of the stem,\n",
            "which caused it to move.\n",
            "And now, in our arms, we would move our muscles,\n",
            "but the plant doesn't have muscles.\n",
            "What it has is water inside the cells\n",
            "and when the voltage hits it, it opens up, releases the water,\n",
            "changes the shape of the cells, and the leaf falls.\n",
            "OK. So here we see an action potential encoding information to move. Alright?\n",
            "But can it do more?\n",
            "So let's go to find out.\n",
            "We're going to go to our good friend, the Venus flytrap here,\n",
            "and we're going to take a look at what happens inside the leaf\n",
            "when a fly lands on here.\n",
            "So I'm going to pretend to be a fly right now.\n",
            "And now here's my Venus flytrap,\n",
            "and inside the leaf, you're going to notice\n",
            "that there are three little hairs here, and those are trigger hairs.\n",
            "And so when a fly lands --\n",
            "I'm going to touch one of the hairs right now.\n",
            "Ready? One, two, three.\n",
            "What do we get? We get a beautiful action potential.\n",
            "However, the flytrap doesn't close.\n",
            "And to understand why that is,\n",
            "we need to know a little bit more about the behavior of the flytrap.\n",
            "Number one is that it takes a long time to open the traps back up --\n",
            "you know, about 24 to 48 hours if there's no fly inside of it.\n",
            "And so it takes a lot of energy.\n",
            "And two, it doesn't need to eat that many flies throughout the year.\n",
            "Only a handful. It gets most of its energy from the sun.\n",
            "It's just trying to replace some nutrients in the ground with flies.\n",
            "And the third thing is,\n",
            "it only opens then closes the traps a handful of times\n",
            "until that trap dies.\n",
            "So therefore, it wants to make really darn sure\n",
            "that there's a meal inside of it before the flytrap snaps shut.\n",
            "So how does it do that?\n",
            "It counts the number of seconds\n",
            "between successive touching of those hairs.\n",
            "And so the idea is that there's a high probability,\n",
            "if there's a fly inside of there, they're going to be quick together,\n",
            "and so when it gets the first action potential,\n",
            "it starts counting, one, two,\n",
            "and if it gets to 20 and it doesn't fire again,\n",
            "then it's not going to close,\n",
            "but if it does it within there, then the flytrap will close.\n",
            "So we're going to go back now.\n",
            "I'm going to touch the Venus flytrap again.\n",
            "I've been talking for more than 20 seconds.\n",
            "So we can see what happens when I touch the hair a second time.\n",
            "So what do we get? We get a second action potential,\n",
            "but again, the leaf doesn't close.\n",
            "So now if I go back in there\n",
            "and if I'm a fly moving around,\n",
            "I'm going to be touching the leaf a few times.\n",
            "I'm going to go and brush it a few times.\n",
            "And immediately,\n",
            "the flytrap closes.\n",
            "So here we are seeing the flytrap actually doing a computation.\n",
            "It's determining if there's a fly inside the trap,\n",
            "and then it closes.\n",
            "So let's go back to our original question.\n",
            "Do plants have brains?\n",
            "Well, the answer is no.\n",
            "There's no brains in here.\n",
            "There's no axons, no neurons.\n",
            "It doesn't get depressed.\n",
            "It doesn't want to know what the Tigers' score is.\n",
            "It doesn't have self-actualization problems.\n",
            "But what it does have is something that's very similar to us,\n",
            "which is the ability to communicate using electricity.\n",
            "It just uses slightly different ions than we do,\n",
            "but it's actually doing the same thing.\n",
            "So just to show you\n",
            "the ubiquitous nature of these action potentials,\n",
            "we saw it in the Venus flytrap,\n",
            "we've seen an action potential in the mimosa.\n",
            "We've even seen an action potential in a human.\n",
            "Now, this is the euro of the brain.\n",
            "It's the way that all information is passed.\n",
            "And so what we can do is we can use those action potentials\n",
            "to pass information\n",
            "between species of plants.\n",
            "And so this is our interspecies plant-to-plant communicator,\n",
            "and what we've done is we've created a brand new experiment\n",
            "where we're going to record the action potential from a Venus flytrap,\n",
            "and we're going to send it into the sensitive mimosa.\n",
            "So I want you to recall what happens\n",
            "when we touch the leaves of the mimosa.\n",
            "It has touch receptors that are sending that information\n",
            "back down in the form of an action potential.\n",
            "And so what would happen\n",
            "if we took the action potential from the Venus flytrap\n",
            "and sent it into all the stems of the mimosa?\n",
            "We should be able to create the behavior of the mimosas\n",
            "without actually touching it ourselves.\n",
            "And so if you'll allow me,\n",
            "I'm going to go ahead and trigger this mimosa right now\n",
            "by touching on the hairs of the Venus flytrap.\n",
            "So we're going to send information about touch from one plant to another.\n",
            "So there you see it.\n",
            "So --\n",
            "(Applause)\n",
            "So I hope you learned a little bit, something about plants today,\n",
            "and not only that.\n",
            "You learned that plants could be used to help teach neuroscience\n",
            "and bring along the neurorevolution.\n",
            "Thank you.\n",
            "(Applause)\n"
